                    <p>The sequences of membrane-spanning domains (MSDs) on the gp41 subunit are highly conserved among
                        many isolates of HIV-1. The GXXXG motif, a potential helix-helix interaction motif, and an
                        arginine residue (rare in hydrophobic MSDs) are especially well conserved. These two conserved
                        elements are expected to locate on the opposite sides of the MSD, if the MSD takes a &#x003b1;-helical
                        secondary structure. A scanning alanine-insertion mutagenesis was performed to elucidate the
                        structure-function relationship of gp41 MSD.

                    <p>A circular dichroism analysis of a synthetic gp41 MSD peptide determined that the secondary
                        structure of the gp41 MSD was &#x003b1;-helical. We then performed a scanning alanine-insertion
                        mutagenesis of the entire gp41 MSD, progressively shifting the relative positions of MSD
                        segments around the helix axis. Altering the position of Gly694, the last residue of the GXXXG
                        motif, relative to Arg696 (the number indicates the position of the amino acid residues in HXB2
                        Env) around the axis resulted in defective fusion. These mutants showed impaired processing of
                        the gp160 precursor into gp120 and gp41. Furthermore, these Env mutants manifested inefficient
                        intracellular transport in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi regions. Indeed, a
                        transplantation of the gp41 MSD portion into the transmembrane domain of another membrane
                        protein, Tac, altered its intracellular distribution. Our json suggest that the intact MSD
                        &#x003b1;-helix is critical in the intracellular trafficking of HIV-1 Env.

            <title>Background</title>
            <p>HIV-1, the retrovirus responsible for the current worldwide AIDS pandemic, is an enveloped virus. The
                envelope protein (Env) of HIV-1 is essential for determining host range and for inducing the membrane
                fusion that allows the virus to enter the host cell. The former and latter functions are mediated by the
                SU (gp120) and the TM (gp41) subunits of the envelope protein, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                                   rid="B1">
                    1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The SU and TM are generated from a precursor
                (gp160) by cellular proteases that recognize a basic amino acid sequence between gp120 and gp41 [<xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This proteolytic
                processing is essential to generate fusion-competent HIV-1 Env and is believed to take place in an early
                Golgi region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].
            </p>
            <p>HIV-1 Env is anchored across lipid bilayers via its highly conserved membrane-spanning domain (MSD)
                [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Although the possibility of a transient alteration of the
                membrane topology exists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">
                    11</xref>], HIV-1 Env is widely believed to be a type I membrane protein with a single &#x003b1;-helical
                MSD in the steady state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Two different models exist within
                the single MSD model of HIV-1 Env. In an initial model, the MSD is supposed to be 23 amino acid residues
                long, ranging from Lys683 to Val704 in the HXB2 sequence, and has a highly conserved hydrophilic
                arginine residue in the midst of its hydrophobic amino acid sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">
                    13</xref>]. In an alternative model, MSD is shorter; and the arginine residue in the lipid bilayer
                is expected to interact with the polar head of the lipid molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">
                    14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].
            </p>
            <p>The primary structure of the MSD of HIV-1 Env also has a GXXXG motif, a motif often found at the
                helix-helix interface of transmembrane &#x003b1;-helices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]; it
                exists upstream of the arginine residue. If an ordinary &#x003b1;-helix structure is assumed for the
                MSD, the GXXXG motif and arginine residue are positioned on opposite sides of the gp41 MSD &#x003b1;-helix.
            </p>
            <p>In vitro studies of the gp41 MSD showed a high tolerance for mutations. For example, the above mentioned
                conserved arginine residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and the GXXXG motif can
                accommodate point mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Even several heterologous MSDs
                can replace the entire gp41 MSD without deteriorating effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These findings led to the notion that the specific amino
                acid sequence in the gp41 MSD has no significant biological role within the limits of the assays used.
                This is a curious notion since the sequence is quite conserved in nature, despite the virus being
                subject to very strong sequence diversification from errors in reverse transcription.
            </p>
            <p>In fact, other studies have suggested that the specific sequence of the gp41 MSD plays a role in the
                function of gp41 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].
                We have shown that replacing the gp41 MSD with MSDs derived from glycophorin A or VSV-G, each containing
                the GXXXG motif, severely decreases the fusion activity of HIV-1 Env [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">
                    18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, simultaneous substitution of all
                three glycine residues, within the GXXXG motif with leucine residues, also negatively affected the
                function of the HIV-1 Env [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Shang et al. recently showed the
                importance of the GXXXG region using a unique genetic approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">
                    24</xref>]. These studies clearly suggested the presence of important information encoded in the
                sequence of MSD. However, the nature of the code is still not evident.
            </p>
            <p>To further elucidate the structure-function relationship of the gp41 MSD, we analyzed a circular
                dichroism (CD) profile of the synthetic peptide corresponding to the MSD and obtained the profile
                expected for &#x003b1;-helical secondary structure. Next, we used the envelope gene of HXB2 [<xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] to create a series of alanine insertion mutants of the
                entire predicted MSD. We found that alteration of the relationship between Gly694 and Arg696 (the number
                indicates the position of the amino acid residues in HXB2 Env) around the axis of the MSD &#x003b1;-helix
                resulted in fusion incompetent Env. These mutant Envs also showed defects in proteolytic processing and
                intracellular transport in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi regions. We further showed that the
                intracellular transport of HIV-1 Env is regulated by the MSD region, through experiments that
                transplanted the gp41 MSD into another membrane protein, Tac. This transplantation led to an alteration
                of the intracellular distribution of Tac, similar to that of HIV-1 Env.

                <title>Circular dichroism analysis of the synthetic MSD peptide in lipid shows &#x003b1;-helical
                    secondary structure
                </title>
                <p>The primary structure of the gp41 MSD is highly conserved, and its secondary structure has been
                    predicted to be an &#x003b1;-helix based on computational algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                                rid="B26">26</xref>].
                    However, there are no physical json to support this expectation. We synthesized a peptide
                    corresponding to a consensus HIV-1 clade B structure of the gp41 MSD and determined its CD spectrum
                    in lipid bilayers. The CD profile, shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, has
                    negative maxima near 208 nm and 222 nm, indicating the presence of an &#x003b1;-helical structure.
                    Although the gp41 MSD of HIV-1 contains three glycine residues, thought to be helix-breaking
                    residues in soluble proteins, the dominant structure indicated by our CD json was an &#x003b1;-helix.
                    Many glycines are found in transmembrane helices. Addition of lysine residues at both ends was
                    necessary to allow us to purify the extremely hydrophobic MSD peptide. We cannot completely exclude
                    the possibility that these lysine residues at the termini, especially at the C-terminus, may
                    stabilize the &#x003b1;-helical structure.

                <p>To identify the region of the gp41 MSD &#x003b1;-helix critical for its function, we generated a set
                    of alanine-insertion mutants covering the entire predicted MSD by using the HXB2 envelope gene. The
                    alanine residue was chosen because it can be well accommodated in an &#x003b1;-helix [<xref

                    mutants. The primary structures of these mutants are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">
                        2</xref>. Nomenclature is based on the positions of the inserted alanine residues in HIV-1 Env.
                    Therefore, 684+A mutant indicates that the inserted alanine residue corresponds to the 684th residue
                    of the envelope protein. The mutant envelope gene was cloned into the envelope expression vector,
                    and the fusion activity of each mutant was determined by the T7 RNA polymerase transfer assay as
                    described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The result is shown in
                    Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>. Among the twenty-two mutants we generated, three
                    showed a prominent decrease in the fusion activity. These three are 694+A, 695+A, and 696+A; their
                    relative fusion activities when compared with the wild type (WT) were 37.5%, 14.0% and 15.5%,
                    respectively. Mutants 695+A and 696+A showed more severe defects than 694+A. Thus the corresponding
                    region from 694 to 696, the G<sup>694</sup>LR<sup>696</sup>region, was shown to be critical for
                    fusion activity.

                <title>The alteration of the phase of the GLR region in MSD was critical to membrane fusion</title>
                <p>The insertion of an alanine residue affects both the length and the phase of the &#x003b1;-helix.
                    However, we expected that the local phase might have a more important role than the length of the
                    MSD because all the insertion mutants generated are expected to have the same length of the MSD. To
                    verify this, we inserted one, two, three, and four alanine residues between residues 694 and 695
                    (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> bottom, 695+2A, 3A, and 4A) and examined the fusion
                    activities of each resulting mutant. The result is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">
                        3B</xref>. The insertion of two residues caused a further decrease in the fusion activity
                    compared to the single insertion (compare 695+A and 695+2A). However, the fusion activity slightly
                    recovered with the insertion of three residues, and almost fully recovered by the insertion of four
                    alanine residues. It seems that there is a correlation between the recovery of the phase of gp41 MSD
                    &#x003b1;-helix and recovery of membrane fusion activity. The observed defect in fusion activity was
                    not due to the increase in length but instead to the local shift of the gp41 MSD &#x003b1;-helix.
                </p>
                <p>To further identify residues critical for determining the phase in the GLR region, we generated
                    696+2A and 695/696+2A (a combination of 695+2A and 696+2A, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2
                    </xref> bottom) and then compared the fusion activity together with 695+2A. Both 695+2A and 696+2A
                    showed severe defects in membrane fusion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).
                    Interestingly, the combination of these two (695/696+2A) recovered fusion activity. The phase
                    commonly altered in the fusion defective mutants, 695+2A and 696+2A, but corrected in the fusion
                    competent 695/696+2A mutants was found to be between Gly694 and Arg696. Thus the relationship
                    between Gly694 and Arg696 seems to be an important factor for the membrane fusion activity.

                <title>Analysis of the protein profile of the fusion-defective mutants reveals impaired processing of
                    gp160 into gp120 and gp41
                </title>
                <p>We analyzed the protein profiles of these mutant Envs by immunoblotting, using anti-gp120 and
                    anti-gp41 antibodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). All mutant Envs were expressed
                    at comparable levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>); however, the fusion-defective
                    mutants had impaired processing of gp160, namely more gp160 than gp120; and accordingly less gp41
                    (see 694+A, 695+A, and 696+A) was observed. This tendency was more prominent for 695+2A and 696+2A,
                    each of which showed severe defects in fusion. A similar correlation between impaired processing of
                    Env and defective membrane fusion was observed in the multiple alanine insertion mutants that showed
                    defective fusion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">
                        4B</xref>). Because the generation of processed gp41 is a prerequisite for fusion competency,
                    this protein profile for inefficient gp160 processing is consistent with the observed fusion defect.
                    Our json showed that the alteration in the &#x003b1;-helical phase in the localized region within
                    gp41 MSD affected processing of gp160 into gp120 and gp41. It was also shown that these mutants were
                    fusion incompetent. A possibility is that the mutations induced allosteric structural changes of the
                    cleavage site so that the mutant Env was no longer processed properly by Furin or Furin-like
                    proteases. However, this idea was not supported by the observation that mutant gp160, purified from
                    COS-7 cells, is cleaved into the gp120 and gp41 subunits by commercially available Furin <italic>in
                        vitro</italic>(Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). We
                    also analyzed the trimerization of Env mutants. The trimer of 695+2A Env was detected (Additional
                    file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) However, the presence of less
                    drastic yet critical structural alterations by the mutation cannot be ruled out completely.

                <title>Alanine insertion in the gp41 MSD can alter the intracellular distribution of Env</title>
                <p>Since processing of gp160 takes place in the Golgi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], we hypothesized that the defect in the processing was
                    derived from the defect in the intracellular trafficking of mutant Env in the endoplasmic reticulum
                    and Golgi regions. To test this possibility, we examined the distribution of mutant Env in the
                    cells. We attached a FLAG tag at the C-terminus of gp41, providing a linear epitope that can be
                    recognized by monoclonal antibody, M2. An ttachment of the FLAG tag did not alter the defect in
                    processing present in alanine insertion mutants (json not shown). The envelope proteins expressed in
                    COS-7 cells were visualized by immunofluorecent assay using the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. We
                    observed that fine, mesh-like fluorescent signals distributing within the transfected cells were
                    more prominent for the mutant 695+2A than the WT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).
                    The intensity of fluorescence derived from Env at the Golgi area was notably weaker for 695+2A than
                    for the WT. These json suggested that mutant Env was defective for transport from ER to Golgi. The
                    level of Env expressed on the cell surface, analyzed by FACS, is consistent with this observation
                    because it is lower for the mutant than for the WT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).

                    that sugar moieties attached to the mutant envelope protein remained as high-mannose types. However,
                    both the WT and mutant envelope proteins generated bands that migrated similarly after treatment

                </title>
                <p>We are interested in determining whether the MSD region alone is sufficient to induce the observed
                    transport defect in the context of other membrane proteins. To test this possibility we have
                    replaced the MSD of Tac, the &#x003b1;-chain of the Interleukin-2 receptor, with the MSD of the wild
                    type (Tac-gp41WT) or 695+2A mutant (Tac-gp41+2A) of gp41, and determined the intracellular
                    distribution of the engineered Tac proteins. We included the intact Tac as a reference (Tac-WT). The
                    results are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>. The signals of intact Tac
                    proteins distributed both in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane areas. They show a fine mesh like
                    appearance in the cytoplasm and are well overlapped with the signals of the ER markers. The intact
                    Tac proteins also showed prominent signals at the rim of the cells suggesting efficient transport to
                    the plasma membrane (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig"
                                                                                                  rid="F8">8D</xref>).
                    There was no overlap of signals for intact Tac and Golgi markers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig"
                                                                                                   rid="F8">8G</xref>).
                    When the MSD of intact Tac proteins was replaced with that of gp41 (wild type in Figure <xref
                            ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B
                    </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E</xref>; 695+2A in C and F), the signals corresponding
                    to the plasma membrane areas became weaker than those of intact Tac (Figure <xref ref-type="fig"
                                                                                                      rid="F8">8</xref>,
                    compare A with B and C; D versus E and F). The majority of the signals was observed in the
                    cytoplasm, and the signals were co-localized with ER markers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">
                        8B
                    </xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>). There are some signals of Tac-gp41 chimera in
                    Golgi areas (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">
                        8I</xref>). Different from the context of HIV-1 envelope proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig"

                    the distribution between the wild type gp41 MSD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> Tac-gp41WT)
                    and 695+2A gp41 MSD (Tac-gp41+2A) in the Golgi areas (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8H</xref> and <xref
                            ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8I</xref>). It appeared that the introduction of the gp41 MSD made
                    chimeric Tac distribute in the cytoplasmic region, mainly ER regions, but the difference between the
                    wild type gp41 and 695+2A mutant became less prominent in the context of Tac than in the context of

            <p>Although the gp41 MSD has three glycine residues, our CD analysis suggested the presence of the &#x003b1;-helical
                structure in gp41 MSD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This may not be a surprise, since
                glycines are abundant in transmembrane helices and glycines are viewed as helix breakers in soluble
                proteins. A recent molecular dynamics study also supports a helical conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                                        rid="B30">
                    30</xref>]. Furthermore, the replacement of all three glycine residues with alanine residues, highly
                &#x003b1;-helix-forming residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                                  rid="B28">28</xref>],
                did not affect the fusion activity of gp41 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus gp41 MSD is
                presumably functional with an &#x003b1;-helical structure. These json, however, do not rule out the
                possibility of the reported transient alteration of the secondary structure of the gp41 MSD during
                membrane fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].
            </p>
            <p>Our scanning alanine insertion mutagenesis identified the topological relationship between Gly694 and
                Arg696 around the MSD &#x003b1;-helix as a critical determinant for the proper processing (Figure <xref
                        ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and intracellular transport (Figure <xref ref-type="fig"
                                                                                                    rid="F5">5</xref>)
                of Env. Since the processing of gp160 is dependent on the proper transport of the proteins to the Golgi
                apparatus, it seemed that the observed defect in processing might be due to a transport defect. However,
                we cannot rule out the possibility of a potential allosteric structural alteration of the Env by
                mutation in the MSD as a cause for the inefficient processing. Indeed our recent json suggested that the
                mutations in the gp41 MSD exert allosteric conformational changes of the ectodomain of HIV-1 Env [<xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].
            </p>
            <p>Mutation at the cleavage site of gp160 eliminates HIV-1 Env fusogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
                7</xref>]. Thus, the defective membrane fusion of our alanine insertion mutants seemed to be derived
                from improper processing of gp160. However, there are other factors contributing to the defective
                fusion. Many studies have shown that mutations in the gp41 MSD affect membrane fusion efficiency [<xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In the context
                of 695+2A mutant, the substitution of hydrophilic arginine residue with non-polar residues (alanine or
                isoleucine) rescues the defective processing (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material"
                                                                                    rid="S3">3</xref>); however, this
                could not resolve the defective fusion (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material"
                                                                              rid="S4">4</xref>). These json suggest
                that gp41 MSD has a role(s) in the membrane fusion process itself. To reveal the exact mechanism,
                further studies are required.
            </p>
            <p>It has been reported that MSD length is crucial for the trafficking of membrane proteins [<xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In HIV-1 Env, length of the MSD alone does not seem to be a
                primary determinant for trafficking. However, our json show that critical information lies in the local
                structure of the transmembrane &#x003b1;-helix of gp41. It is possible that the alteration of structural
                features in the MSD region can be sensed by host factor(s) involved in the protein quality control
                system. This detection could be through the MSD region itself. In a yeast system, some proteins involved
                in the vesicular transport in ER-Golgi where target recognition was achieved via the MSD region have
                been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].
                Since the distribution of our Tac-gp41 chimera was heavily affected by the replacement of the MSD region
                alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>), it may support such a hypothesis. Such a
                hypothetical factor may recognize wild type gp41 MSD via the GXXXG motif facing outward in relationship
                to the MSD bundle, if the gp41 MSDs interact with each other through arginine residues as suggested
                recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].
            </p>
            <p>Notably, our alanine insertion mutation altered the relative positioning of the GXXXG motif and arginine
                residue within the gp41 MSD. Both are major interaction motifs between transmembrane &#x003b1;-helices [<xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Although recent
                electron cryomicroscopic json [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr"
                                                                                               rid="B38">38</xref>] did
                not provide a spatial arrangement of the gp41 MSD portions, it is possible that there are interactions
                between the gp41 MSDs during the biosynthesis of the HIV-1 Env. Our alanine insertion may disrupt the
                interaction among MSDs. This disturbance of interhelical interactions may result in altered
                intracellular transport. The failure to reproduce differences in intracellular distribution between the
                wild type and 695+2A MSD, in the context of Tac (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8, B-I</xref>),
                may arise from the difference in the oligomeric status between HIV-1 Env (trimer) and Tac (monomer). Our
                json suggest that mutant Env still forms a trimer (Additional file <xref
                        ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).
            </p>
            <p>Our json clearly demonstrate that the MSD of gp41 has important functions in the biosynthesis of HIV-1
                Env, apart from the simple anchoring and modulation of fusion efficiency. The exact regulation mechanism
                of intracellular distribution of HIV-1 Env by the MSD portion is not known; however, it could be of
                great importance to determine whether there are any cellular factors that specifically recognize the MSD
                region of HIV-1 Env.

            <title>Conclusions</title>
            <p>We have shown that the secondary structure of the synthetic peptide of gp41 MSD is an &#x003b1;-helix.
                Based on this information, we performed a scanning alanine insertion mutagenesis which showed that
                alteration of the topological relationship between conserved GXXXG motif and the arginine residue
                resulted in non-functional Env. The mutant Env manifested a reduced fusion activity and impaired the
                processing of gp160 into gp120 and gp41. Furthermore, the intracellular transport of mutant Env was
                affected in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi areas. Our json suggested that the specific &#x003b1;-helical
                structural feature of gp41 MSD controls the biosynthesis of HIV-1 Env.

                <p>A 3 &#x000d7; FLAG tag was added to the C-terminus of gp41 by inserting oligonucleotides
                    corresponding to the 3 &#x000d7; FLAG tag sequence derived from the vector p3xFLAG-CMV&#x02122;-7.1
                    (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Following this insertion, the amino acid sequence after the C-terminus of
                    gp41 reads as RSARDYKDHDGDYKDHDIDYKDDDDK. The expression vector of FLAG-tagged Env was called
                    pElucEnv-3FLAG Env.
