This technique allows for sequence-specific induction of double-strand breaks in genomic DNA of individual cells, effectively resulting in knock-out of targeted genes. It thus promises to be an ideal candidate for application in neuroscience where constitutive genetic modifications are frequently either lethal or ineffective due to adaptive changes of the brain. Here we use CRISPR/Cas9 to knock-out <italic>Grin1</italic>, the gene encoding the obligatory NMDA receptor subunit protein GluN1, in a sparse population of mouse pyramidal neurons. Within this genetically mosaic tissue, manipulated cells lack synaptic current mediated by NMDA-type glutamate receptors consistent with complete knock-out of the targeted gene.

In neuroscience this approach has been used widely, but results are often limited by several technical difficulties. First, a significant subset of genes is essential for survival, and genomic deletion is lethal <xref rid="pone.0105584-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Second, the plasticity of the brain can lead to developmental compensation for deleted genes, thereby obscuring the effect <xref rid="pone.0105584-Picciotto1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. These problems have been circumvented by generating conditional knock-out mice, in which genomic deletion of a gene depends on the presence of a recombinase whose expression can be spatially and/or temporally restricted <xref rid="pone.0105584-Tsien1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, this approach still requires the generation of germline genetically modified mice, a process that takes at least several months.</p><p>The difficulties of conventional transgenic mouse models could be overcome by efficient genome editing methods that would allow controlled perturbation in post-mitotic neurons. The type II prokaryotic adaptive immune system (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)) <xref rid="pone.0105584-Deveau1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> with the endonuclease CRISPR-associated (Cas) 9 has recently been engineered for this use in mammalian cells <xref rid="pone.0105584-Cong1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105584-Mali1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In addition to the endonuclease Cas9, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing requires two short RNAs, a target-recognizing CRISPR-RNA, and a Cas9-recruiting tracer-RNA; both RNAs can be linked together as single guide-RNA (gRNA) <xref rid="pone.0105584-Ran1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. When co-expressed with an appropriate gRNA, Cas9 is recruited to the genomic DNA in a sequence-specific manner, and cuts both strands at a precise location. The genomic DNA is then repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), introducing mutations that effectively interrupt the open reading frame, and thereby results in a functional knock-out of the encoded protein <xref rid="pone.0105584-Ran1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Since its first application in mammalian cells, CRISPR/Cas9 has been used in many different organisms and applications <xref rid="pone.0105584-Friedland1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0105584-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>; however, it is still unknown if this system can be used in mammalian neurons to generate genetically mosaic brain tissue.

Slice cultures were prepared from P6&#x02013;8 wild-type Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously <xref rid="pone.0105584-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Slice cultures were maintained at 34&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> on 30 mm Millicell Cell Culture inserts with 0.4 um pores (Millipore) in slice culture media containing: MEM (8.32 g/L), 20% heat-inactivated horse serum, 1 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, insulin (1 mg/l), 13 mM D-Glucose, 5.2 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 30 mM HEPES, and 0.00125% ascorbic acid.

For biolistic transfection, a DNA mixture containing 50 &#x000b5;g of the CRISPR-construct and 30 &#x000b5;g of a GFP-expressing plasmid were precipitated onto 1 &#x000b5;m diameter gold particles, washed with ethanol, and coated onto the inside of Tefzel tubing (Bio-rad). After 2&#x02013;3 days in vitro, slice cultures were shot with the DNA-coated gold cartridges using 100 PSI ultra-pure helium with a Helios GeneGun (BioRad).

Transfected CA1 and CA3 neurons were recorded from 300 &#x000b5;m acute, horizontal brain slices of P14&#x02013;20 mice, cut using a vibratome (Leica Biosystems) in a chilled sucrose cut solution containing (in mM): 2.5 KCl, 7 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 7 glucose, 210 sucrose, 1.3 ascorbic acid, and 3 sodium pyruvate.

Both the cut solution and ACSF were bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub> gas throughout dissection, slicing and recording. During recording, slices were perfused at a rate of 250 ml/hr with ACSF. 10 &#x000b5;M SR 95531 (Tocris) was added to the ACSF to block inhibition. For recordings from organotypic slice cultures, CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration were both increased to 4 mM and 10 &#x000b5;M 2-chloroadensine (Tocris) added to prevent runaway excitation following stimulation. Synaptic responses were evoked using electrical stimulation of stratum radiatum from a tungsten bipolar electrode (FHC). To minimize polysynaptic responses, a cut was made at the border of CA3 and CA1 using a microscalpel (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Whole-cell recordings were made using 3&#x02013;5 M&#x003a9; glass pipettes filled with internal solution containing (in mM): 135&#x02009;CsMeSO<sub>4</sub>, 8&#x02009;NaCl, 10&#x02009;HEPES, 0.3&#x02009;EGTA, 5&#x02009;QX-314, 4&#x02009;Mg-ATP, 0.3&#x02009;Na-GTP, and 0.1 spermine, at 294 mOsm and pH 7.34.

These two values were used to calculate the NMDA/AMPA ratio, and for each cell the holding potential was switched several times back and forth during the recording, to account for potential changes in the evoked response over time.

This subunit is essential for NMDAR function <xref rid="pone.0105584-Traynelis1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and the degree of GluN1 loss can be easily assayed by the amplitude of synaptic NMDAR currents <xref rid="pone.0105584-Alvarez1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Additionally, constitutive genomic deletion of <italic>Grin1</italic> is embryonic lethal <xref rid="pone.0105584-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, whereas a hypomorphic allele shows decreased NMDAR currents and severe neural dysfunction early in development <xref rid="pone.0105584-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. A conditional GluN1 knockout mouse has been generated <xref rid="pone.0105584-Tsien2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and sparse transfection of Cre has been used to examine the effect of NMDAR deletion in individual hippocampal neurons <xref rid="pone.0105584-Adesnik1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0105584-Granger1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Thus, targeting GluN1 provides a well-characterized and robust experimental system to assay for the deletion of an essential protein in individual neurons of an otherwise unperturbed brain.</p><p>We identified two genomic CRISPR/Cas9 target sequences (see methods) within or near the region encoding for the second, pore-forming transmembrane domain of GluN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105584-g001">Figure 1A, B</xref>). &#x02018;CC_Grin1.1&#x02019; is located on the sense strand of exon 14, spanning the sequence that encodes the beginning of the second transmembrane domain; &#x02018;CC_Grin1.2&#x02019; is on the intron anti-sense strand between exon 13 and 14, about 130 bp upstream of CC_Grin1.1. The appropriate sequences were subcloned into a vector containing all other elements required for CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knock-down <xref rid="pone.0105584-Ran1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Identification of target sequences and the required cloning required less than three days, emphasizing the simplicity and effectiveness of this approach.</p><p>To functionally assay for NMDAR-deletion, CC_Grin1.1 and CC_Grin1.2 were transfected by <italic>in-utero</italic> electroporation into the hippocampus of wildtype mice, and a plasmid encoding GFP was co-transfected at a 1&#x02236;10 ratio. We measured the ratio of NMDAR-over AMPAR- (&#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor) mediated currents at CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons (see methods), following electrical stimulation of dentate gyrus mossy fiber (MF) and CA3 Shaffer collaterals (SC) pathways, respectively. The ratio of the amplitudes of NMDAR and AMPAR mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in untransfected pyramidal neurons was 0.61&#x000b1;0.04 (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;36), and transfection of a CRISPR/Cas9 construct lacking the targeting sequence (&#x02018;pX330&#x02019;) had no effect on this ratio (0.53&#x000b1;0.05, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8). In contrast, cells transfected with CC_Grin1.1 showed complete loss of NMDAR currents (0.04&#x000b1;0.01, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;12). Importantly, the functional loss of NMDAR by CC_Grin1.1 was observed in every cell tested, demonstrating effective CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockdown with full penetrance and suggesting disruption of both genomic alleles. Using the same approach with CC_Grin1.2 did not show any effect (0.67&#x000b1;0.11, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10), and every cell tested showed robust NMDAR currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105584-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Together, the results demonstrate that CRISP/Cas9-mediated knockdown can be applied to neurons <italic>in</italic>
<italic>vivo</italic>. However, since both CC_Grin1.1 and CC_Grin1.2 had similarly high predicted &#x02018;on-target scores&#x02019; (94% and 92%, respectively) these results also show that any given target sequence needs to be confirmed individually.</p><p>Acute knockdown in the brain requires genetic modification in neurons &#x02013; i.e. in post-mitotic cells. Since <italic>in-utero</italic> electroporation functions by transfecting mitotic precursor cells, we repeated our experiments in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, where biolistic transfection occurs in post-mitotic neurons. The slice cultures were prepared from rat; however, the target sequence of CC_Grin1.1 is fully conserved between mouse and rat. Following 10 days of expression, CC_Grin1.1 significantly reduced NMDAR currents compared to untransfected neighboring control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105584-g002">Figure 2</xref>, left). However, some cells still showed a small residual NMDAR current, presumably due to slow turn-over of NMDAR protein <xref rid="pone.0105584-Gray1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. We therefore repeated the experiment and expressed CC_Grin1.1 for 18 days, comparable to the expression time in acute slices following <italic>in-utero</italic> electroporation. This time window was enough to eliminate all NMDAR currents in CC_Grin1.1 transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0105584-g002">Figure 2</xref>, right).

The number of cells depends purely on the transfection efficiency, and this method is therefore ideally suited to prevent plastic adaption that can obscure knock-down effects. In comparison to other acute knock-down methods, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-down is either more efficient and complete (e.g. RNA-interference based approaches <xref rid="pone.0105584-Alvarez1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>) or faster (generation of conditional knock-out mice and subsequent transfection with Cre), making it the ideal candidate for the investigation of neuronal function.</p><p>However, several technical challenges remain to be considered for use of CRISPR/Cas9 in neurons. A principal concern for the use of CRISP/Cas9 is that of off-target effects, which can be expected from a method that relies on a 20 bp recognition motif.

Guide RNA target-sequences will therefore not only need to be screened for efficacy, but selected to attempt to minimize off-target effects. Another important point for future use of CRISPR/Cas9 in the brain will be the development of effective gene delivery methods. Both <italic>in-utero</italic> electroporation and biolistic transfection of slice cultures allow for delivery of multiple large expression constructs, but are limited in terms of spatial and temporal specificity.
