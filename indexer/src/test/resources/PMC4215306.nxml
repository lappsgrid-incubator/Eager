Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a critical technique for providing information regarding the organization of cellular and magnetite structures in these microorganisms. However, conventional TEM can only be used to image air-dried or vitrified bacteria removed from their natural environment. Here we present a correlative scanning TEM (STEM) and fluorescence microscopy technique for imaging viable cells of <italic>Magnetospirillum magneticum</italic> strain AMB-1 in liquid using an <italic>in situ</italic> fluid cell TEM holder. Fluorescently labeled cells were immobilized on microchip window surfaces and visualized in a fluid cell with STEM, followed by correlative fluorescence imaging to verify their membrane integrity. Notably, the post-STEM fluorescence imaging indicated that the bacterial cell wall membrane did not sustain radiation damage during STEM imaging at low electron dose conditions. We investigated the effects of radiation damage and sample preparation on the bacteria viability and found that approximately 50% of the bacterial membranes remained intact after an hour in the fluid cell, decreasing to ~30% after two hours. These results represent a first step toward <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of magnetite biomineralization in magnetotactic bacteria.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Biomineralization is a widespread biological phenomenon occurring in living organisms ranging from single cells to complex multicellular organisms.

Understanding biomineralization in these organisms in terms of crystal nucleation and growth, as well as the involvement of biological macromolecules and cellular processes, is of fundamental interest to scientists as similar principles can be used to develop synthetic nanomaterials.</p><p>Magnetite biomineralization by magnetotactic bacteria is a topic of great interest in nanotechnology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, functional materials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, and astrobiology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Magnetotactic bacteria take up soluble iron species that they use to biomineralize chains of magnetite nanocrystals, known as magnetosomes, in intracellular membrane vesicles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The nanocrystals have nearly perfect mineral crystal structures with consistent species-specific morphologies, leading to well-defined magnetic properties<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. As a result, magnetotactic bacteria are one of the best model systems for investigating the molecular mechanisms of biomineralization. Magnetite biomineralization in these bacteria is a complex process involving a number of steps including cellular uptake and reduction of ferric ions, complexation of the iron with membrane proteins, and nucleation and growth of mature magnetosomes (cf. Fig. 6 in Faivre and Schuler<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Despite decades of intense research, this process is still not fully understood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Biological macromolecules, specifically membrane bound proteins in magnetotactic bacteria, play an important role in templating biomineralized magnetosome magnetite crystals, although their exact role remains unclear<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>The variety of processes involved in magnetosome formation, ranging from the bacterial uptake of iron to nucleation and growth of nanoscale magnetite, necessitates the use of various analytical techniques. Materials characterization techniques are typically aimed at direct observations of the magnetite nucleation and growth at high spatial resolution. High resolution TEM is often used to observe formation of magnetosomes in magnetotactic bacteria <italic>via</italic> cryogenic TEM (cryo-TEM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. This technique provides vital information about organization of the cellular structures and development of the magnetosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. However, the vitreous ice environment of cryo-TEM samples may not be entirely representative of the native hydrated cellular state, and may introduce artifacts due to the preparatory protocols often involving addition of cryo-protectants, thin sectioning, and sample staining. Fluorescence microscopy is often employed in conjunction with TEM imaging to study dynamic biomolecular processes in magnetotactic bacteria, such as localization of membrane proteins during bacteria growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The spatial resolution of fluorescence microscopy is limited by the diffraction limit to ~200&#x02005;nm, so establishing connections between biomolecular processes and magnetosome growth mechanisms relies on correlation with cryo-TEM. Correlative cryo-TEM and optical techniques are very complex, often involving computer transfer of sample positions obtained in the optical microscope to the electron microscope <italic>via</italic> specialized software<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.</p><p>Fluid cell TEM and scanning TEM (STEM) techniques are unique in that they can be used to directly observe biomacromolecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and whole cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> in their fully hydrated state. The experimental setup typically consists of a microfluidic chamber comprised of two silicon chips with electron transparent silicon nitride (SiN) windows contained in a hermetically sealed TEM holder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. A thin liquid layer containing the specimen is maintained between the SiN windows; for whole eukaryotic cells the liquid thickness is typically on the order of microns, limiting the spatial resolution to nanometers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Because biological specimens in these thick liquid layers lack sufficient contrast, they are typically incubated with high contrast nanoparticles such as gold<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> or CdSe quantum dots<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> and imaged with high angle annular dark field (HAADF) STEM, i.e. Z-contrast imaging. De Jonge and co-workers have established correlative fluid cell STEM and fluorescence microscopy as a powerful technique for studying various aspects of eukaryotic cells, such as locating epidermal growth factor receptors in COS7 cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, exploring the correlation between cellular function and ultrastructure in yeast cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, and investigating electron beam damage and cell viability in live COS7 cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Other electron microscopy techniques exist for imaging whole hydrated cells, such as environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, and air SEM (ASEM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. The cells in these techniques are typically chemically fixed and maintained in a vacuum, making live cell imaging impossible; however, important information about cell receptors can be obtained by incubating the cells with nanoparticles prior to fixation and imaging<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>.</p><p>In this report, we utilize correlative fluorescence and fluid cell STEM imaging to visualize magnetotactic bacteria containing nanoscale biomineralized magnetosomes. We show that HAADF-STEM imaging reveals the bacteria cell membrane in some cases even when magnetite magnetosomes are not present, which is imperative for on-going <italic>in vivo</italic> magnetite biomineralization studies in the fluid cell. The confined environment of the fluid cell causes a rapid decrease in bacteria viability over a time of two hours, necessitating the use of post-STEM fluorescence microscopy to verify bacteria membrane integrity. We present new criteria for imaging initially live bacteria in the fluid cell, and discuss various radiation damage thresholds and other cell damage mechanisms for fluid cell STEM imaging of bacteria. Correlative STEM and fluorescence imaging of magnetotactic bacteria is a first step in observing biomineralization of magnetite nanocrystals <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the described approach is expected to be applicable to a broad range of microorganisms that biomineralize various nanomaterials.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Electron microscopy of air-dried magnetotactic bacteria</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> shows the experimental setup used for the correlative STEM and fluorescence imaging of magnetotactic bacteria.

Methods) and sandwiched with another 100&#x02005;nm spacer chip, as schematically shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>. The tip of the liquid cell is removed from the STEM holder platform, mounted on a glass slide and accepted by the fluorescence microscope for imaging with a 40X objective lens, as schematically shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>.</p><p>Cells of <italic>M. magneticum</italic>, strain AMB-1, are helical in shape and typically 1&#x02013;3&#x02005;&#x000b5;m in length and 0.4&#x02013;0.6&#x02005;&#x000b5;m in diameter<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. They produce chains of approximately 10&#x02013;15 cuboctahedral magnetite magnetosomes, each on the order of 50&#x02005;nm in size<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. A typical HAADF-STEM image of an air-dried, fixed cell of <italic>M. magneticum</italic> on a grid is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>. The magnetosome chains are situated inside the cytoplasmic membrane of the bacterium, held together by networks of actin-like filaments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, white arrow). The term magnetosome refers to the inorganic magnetite nanocrystal along with the enveloping organic vesicle (cf. HRTEM images in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supp. Fig. 1</xref>). Other than the magnetosomes, only the cytoplasm of the cell is visible in the HAADF-STEM image; the rest of the cell ultrastructure is not visible due to minor differences in the Z-contrast between various cellular structures. Energy filtered TEM (EFTEM) elemental maps of a single cell of <italic>M. magneticum</italic> on a grid confirm the presence of oxygen in the cytoplasm (green contrast, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>) as well as increased amounts of oxygen in the magnetite magnetosome crystals. An increased iron signal in the nanocrystals (purple contrast) confirms that they consist of an iron oxide species. While imaging magnetotactic bacteria on carbon grids allows for morphological and chemical analysis of the magnetosome structures, glutaraldehyde fixation and the harsh environment of the vacuum makes imaging of the bacteria in their native hydrated state impossible.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Fluid cell STEM imaging</title><p>Briefly, cells of <italic>M. magneticum</italic> were suspended in growth media and labeled with SYTO 9 and propidium iodide fluorescence dyes and attached to a poly-L-lysine coated 100&#x02005;nm SiN spacer chip (APTES or BioPlus chips used in other cases will be indicated) and sandwiched with another 100&#x02005;nm spacer chip (cf. Methods). A flow of fresh media was introduced through the fluid cell prior to STEM imaging to remove excess fluorescence dye; however, there was no fluid flow during STEM imaging (cf. Methods). At the nominal liquid layer thickness of 200&#x02005;nm the presence of flow could not be confirmed reproducibly, although diffusion of fluorescent dye out of the sample area could not be ruled out. The bacterial cells were kept in a static environment of media during imaging, typically for two hours. Low-loss electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) revealed that the liquid layer thickness was typically 500&#x02013;750&#x02005;nm at the edges and corners of the SiN window for this spacer configuration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. The HAADF-STEM images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> were acquired with a beam current of 38&#x02005;pA, yielding a cumulative electron dose of 0.09 electrons <bold>&#x000b7;</bold> &#x000c5;<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> and 0.34 electrons <bold>&#x000b7;</bold> &#x000c5;<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> shows a low magnification false colored HAADF-STEM image of ~30 cells attached in the corner of the SiN window. The bacterial magnetosomes are clearly visible in green as well as the cytoplasm of the cells, which appear as a light blue contrast above the dark blue background of the fluid (e.g. red dashed line shows the approximate position of the cytoplasm in a single cell). The majority of previous biological cell STEM imaging studies in fluids have employed high-contrast labels, such as gold nanoparticles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and quantum dots<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, to provide contrast in HAADF-STEM images. In our experiments, the biomineralized magnetite magnetosome chains in cells of <italic>M. magneticum</italic> act as natural high-contrast labels denoting the position of the bacterial cells. Furthermore, alignment of the magnetite nanocrystals in chains is an indicator of the integrity of the bacterium's cellular structure&#x02014;chains of magnetosomes indicate that the cell membrane and magnetosome membrane vesicles are intact, held together by networks of filaments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. In contrast, lysed bacterial cells would only show collapsed chains or free floating magnetosomes. The bacterial cell wall membrane is typically only visible when the bacterium is near a corner of the SiN window, where the liquid layer is thinnest and the spatial resolution is highest. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref> shows a higher magnification image of two cells of <italic>M. magneticum</italic>. In this case the cells were not close to the SiN window corner, so the cell walls are not as visible as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>. The approximate position of the membrane on the upper cell in the figure is outlined with a dashed red line. With poly-L-lysine coated windows, the cells were strongly attached and imaged at magnifications up to <italic>M</italic> = 28,000 <italic>x</italic> without detachment of the bacteria from the SiN window. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref> shows cells of <italic>M. magneticum</italic> attached to a SiN window without any functionalization. In this experiment, cells were grown in an iron deficient medium so some cells had only partially formed magnetosome chains, while others did not contain any magnetosomes at all (white arrows). There are two noteworthy features in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>. Importantly, the cells with no magnetosome chains were still visible in the fluid cell, indicating that imaging of initially &#x0201c;non-magnetic&#x0201d; bacteria for future <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of magnetite biomineralization is possible. This image also demonstrates the importance of bacterial attachment to the SiN window; with no poly-L-lysine coating on the SiN in this case, some cells were mobile under the electron beam, indicated by streaking in the STEM image (red arrow). In this case, the SiN windows and cells had a negative surface charge, and attachment was much weaker than with the poly-L-lysine treated SiN. It is therefore important to functionalize the SiN window to create a positively charged surface that induces strong electrostatic attachment of the negatively charged bacterial cells. Poly-L-lysine, APTES-functionalized, and BioPlus chips all encouraged consistent attachment of cells, with all the coatings giving qualitatively similar attachment properties.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Electron beam exposure</title><p>The effect of the electron beam on bacterial cells in the fluid cell was investigated by exposing them to sequential STEM exposures. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref> shows two HAADF-STEM images of a single cell exposed to various electron doses indicated in each image. These images were acquired at a magnification of <italic>M</italic> = 28,000 <italic>x</italic>, beam current of 38&#x02005;<italic>pA</italic>, and pixel dwell time of 8&#x02005;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>s, yielding a cumulative electron dose per image of 2.4 electrons <bold>&#x000b7;</bold> &#x000c5;<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. The magnetosome chain in the first STEM image was approximately 1.15&#x02005;&#x003bc;<italic>m</italic> in length after being exposed to a cumulative electron dose of 2.4 electrons <bold>&#x000b7;</bold> &#x000c5;<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>); however, after two more consecutive STEM images and three times the cumulative dose of the first image, the chain length contracted by 9% to 1.05&#x02005;&#x003bc;<italic>m</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Further contraction of the chain was observed with continued electron beam irradiation. No direct electron beam damage to the magnetite magnetosomes was observed after acquiring three STEM images. Radiolysis damage of the bacterial cytoplasm at these high cumulative electron doses likely led to shrinkage of the entire cell, manifested as a contraction of the magnetosome chain. A single STEM image acquired below a cumulative electron dose of ~0.1 electron <bold>&#x000b7;</bold>&#x000c5;<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> did not induce any observable magnetosome chain shrinkage.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Fluorescence Microscopy</title><p>SYTO 9 and propidium iodide fluorescent dyes were used to test the membrane integrity of cells of <italic>M. magneticum</italic> (cf. Methods). To test the dye protocol for establishing membrane integrity in this specific bacterial strain, we prepared live and dead reference samples on cover slips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Once bound to a nucleic acid, SYTO 9 fluoresces green while propidium iodide fluoresces red; however, propidium iodide is membrane impermeable. Cells with undamaged membranes will therefore only fluoresce green, while those with damaged membranes will fluoresce both red and green. The reference samples were prepared at the same concentration as a typical fluid cell sample, the dead reference sample was killed with 10% isopropyl alcohol prior to staining. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref> shows that the live cells of <italic>M. magneticum</italic> retain their helical shape and show only green fluorescence in the composite image (e.g. white arrows), indicating that they had undamaged cell membranes. On the other hand, killed cells fluoresced both green and red in the composite image, indicating that their membranes were damaged allowing binding of propidium iodide to nucleic acids in the bacteria cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Many killed cells also had a spherical shape, either as a result of the bacteria rolling up on itself upon exposure to isopropyl alcohol, or due to the lysis of the outer membrane and loss of peptidoglycan. The live and dead reference samples indicate that this two-part staining protocol is a valid method for assessing membrane integrity of cells of <italic>M. magneticum</italic> in the fluid cell.</p><p>Fluorescence imaging of cells of <italic>M. magneticum</italic> in the fluid cell was performed to identify the positions of viable cells prior to STEM imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). In this experiment, cells were attached to an APTES-coated 100&#x02005;nm SiN spacer, paired with an uncoated 100&#x02005;nm SiN spacer. The brightfield contrast on the SiN window is due to thickness variations in the liquid layer due to the presence of debris and cells, both denoted in the image with arrows. Both intact and damaged bacteria can be observed in the fluid cell sample prior to STEM imaging. Approximately half of the cells had intact membranes ~40 minutes after closing the fluid cell. Membrane integrity was typically much higher on cover slip samples (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), so we performed systematic fluorescence microscopy experiments to understand the effect of confinement in the fluid cell on bacterial membrane integrity.</p><p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>, it appears that simply loading the magnetotactic bacteria in the fluid cell drastically decreased their viability even before STEM imaging. We acquired fluorescence images of cells attached to a BioPlus chip every 10 minutes to systematically test bacteria viability as a function of time in the fluid cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figs. 6a and 6b</xref> show example fluorescence images taken after 40 and 110 minutes in the fluid cell, respectively.

Initial fluorescence imaging was performed ~30&#x02005;min after assembling the fluid cell to locate viable cells for higher resolution STEM imaging (not shown). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref> shows a HAADF-STEM image of two cells near the corner of the SiN window, indicated by their magnetosome chains (<italic>M</italic> = 9,900 <italic>x</italic>, <italic>d</italic> = 0.17 electrons<bold>&#x000b7;</bold>&#x000c5;<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>). In this case the bacterial membranes cannot be seen because the fluid layer is too thick. In a typical correlative microscopy technique, fluorescence microscopy is only performed <italic>first</italic> to determine areas of interest and imaging concludes with electron microscopy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>; however, the rapid decrease in bacterial viability in the fluid cell also necessitated fluorescence imaging after STEM. Approximately 20&#x02005;min after the STEM image was acquired, the fluid cell was imaged in the fluorescence microscope to test bacterial viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). We located the same cells that are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref> in the fluorescence microscope using the SiN window edges and cellular orientation as fiducials (red box). To correlate the STEM and composite fluorescence images, the STEM image was rotated and the composite fluorescence image was cropped, rendered partially transparent, and overlaid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7c</xref>). While only the magnetite magnetosomes can be observed in the STEM image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>), correlation with the fluorescence image reveals the cytoplasm. Importantly, this image demonstrates that the bacterial cell membranes were not damaged after a single STEM exposure, at least for the cumulative electron dose used in this case.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Mitigating radiation damage is critical for electron microscopy of biological samples, especially for fluid cell STEM imaging, which has been shown to have a number of electron beam induced artifacts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Cumulative electron doses on the order of magnitude used here (~0.1 electrons<bold>&#x000b7;</bold>&#x000c5;<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) coincide with a recent fluid cell STEM study of gold nanoparticle uptake into eukaryotic cells; these doses were shown to induce only small changes in the cellular structure with a single STEM exposure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. The authors proposed that the first STEM image obtained at the outer cellular region contained information of the ultrastructure of the live cell and subsequent images in other areas likely contained information about the live cell as well. However, for the case of bacteria imaged at the low magnifications in this study, a single STEM exposure irradiates the entire cell at once. Therefore, in this paper, only the first HAADF-STEM images acquired of cells of <italic>M. magneticum</italic> have been shown as they are the most representative of the initial cellular structure.</p><p>While we can use previous fluid cell STEM studies of radiation damage in eukaryotic cells as general guidelines for live imaging of magnetotactic bacteria, the question remains, are the bacterial cells alive following STEM imaging? The death of a bacterial cell is often defined as the inability of the cell to grow into a visible colony in media<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Another commonly used indicator of bacterial viability is cell mobility. In our experiments, it was necessary to attach the cells to the SiN windows to immobilize them for STEM imaging, so we could not evaluate bacterial viability on the basis of either of these criteria. This limits our indicators of radiation damage to cellular function to observations of bacterial shrinkage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>) and membrane viability <italic>via</italic> fluorescence labeling and imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>), neither of which can be used to directly assess enzymatic or reproductive damage of the cells. Intermediate fluorescence states identified in SYTO 9/propidium iodide labeled cells of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> suggested that fluorescent labeling can indicate more than simply membrane integrity, but it was unclear exactly how these states related to specific cell functions and reproductive health of the bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. The cumulative electron doses used in this study are at least four orders of magnitude higher than the lethal electron dose of ~10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> electrons<bold>&#x000b7;</bold>&#x000c5;<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> shown to cause reproductive death and enzyme deactivation in <italic>E. coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. The lethal electron dose was measured from pulsed electron beam experiments (E = 520&#x02005;keV) of <italic>E. coli</italic> on wet Millipore filters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>; such a thick sample would absorb more ionizing radiation and facilitate more damage to the bacteria than for fluid cell STEM imaging, which allows for transmission of most of the electrons. Furthermore, calculation of the lethal electron dose assumed TEM irradiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>, which delivers a continuous flux of electrons over a micron sized area, whereas STEM imaging delivers electrons in a nanometer sized probe scanned serially across the sample. Due to these differences, we cannot conclude whether the same lethal electron dose exists for fluid cell STEM imaging of magnetotactic bacteria. Cellular processes in the cells of <italic>M. magneticum</italic> are likely altered or damaged, but further work on the viability of electron irradiated bacteria in the fluid cell will be needed to establish a lethal electron dose for STEM imaging.</p><p>While the electron doses used here have been shown to cause various types of damage in cells of <italic>E. coli</italic>, they are two or more orders of magnitude below the established damage threshold for cryo-TEM and radiation damage of nucleic acids (~10 electrons<bold>&#x000b7;</bold>&#x000c5;<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>, and one order of magnitude below the damage threshold for amino acids (~1 electron<bold>&#x000b7;</bold>&#x000c5;<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Imaging at electron doses higher than the radiation damage threshold for amino acids induced damage in the form of magnetosome chain shrinkage, likely due to radiation damage of the bacterial cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Importantly, this suggests that as long as the cumulative electron dose for a STEM image is &#x0003c;1 electron<bold>&#x000b7;</bold>&#x000c5;<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, the structure of the magnetosome exists in an environment representative of the initial cellular state, even if some of the cellular processes have been altered or arrested due to irradiation. The fact that we image at cumulative doses below the nucleic and amino acid damage thresholds further corroborates our observations of intact bacterial cell membranes following fluid cell STEM imaging. We expect these radiation damage thresholds to be generally applicable to fluid cell electron microscopy imaging of most prokaryotes.</p><p>We must also consider changes to the bacterial cells due to fluid cell sample preparation. Potential causes of bacterial membrane damage in the fluid cell include confinement between the two SiN windows, the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in the fluorescent dye, and non-ideal oxygen conditions in the growth media. Magnetotactic bacteria are cultured under microaerobic conditions (0.25 mbar is optimum for magnetosome biomineralization by <italic>M. Magneticum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>), and the small amount of media contained between the SiN windows in the fluid cell quickly saturates to atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> levels, creating a non-ideal, possibly toxic, environment for the bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. However, this particular strain of <italic>M.</italic>
<italic>magneticum</italic> is known to be relatively oxygen resistant, and the amount of DMSO in the media is likely below toxic levels, so confinement of the cells is likely the explanation for cell damage. Confinement of the bacterial cells in a hundreds of nanometers thick liquid layer creates compressive stresses on the bacterial cells. Compressive stresses have been shown to increase membrane permeability and damage efflux systems in <italic>E. coli</italic>, leading to increased absorption of propidium iodide<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. High pressures have also been shown to lead to increased rates of cell lysis in <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> strains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Our systematic fluorescence imaging showed increased propidium iodide absorption into the cells upon sample preparation and over the two hours in the fluid cell; however, cell lysis was not observed. While the exact cause of the rapid decrease in viability over two hours in the fluid cell is not entirely clear, it necessitates correlative fluorescence imaging <italic>after</italic> STEM imaging as well, to verify bacterial membrane viability in the electron microscopy images.</p><p>Taken together, our bacterial viability experiments and the cumulative electron doses used strongly suggest that some bacterial cells remain alive in the fluid cell up to the point of electron beam irradiation. After STEM imaging, cellular function is altered or arrested due to radiation induced enzyme deactivation and possible reproductive death of the cell. Given these conclusions, we expect <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of magnetosome biomineralization in initially live magnetotactic bacteria will be possible using fluid cell STEM imaging. The flow capabilities of the fluid cell will allow for controllable introduction of iron-replete growth media to an iron-deficient bacterial culture. While high resolution microscopy of the magnetosome structure in live bacteria currently may not be possible due to radiation damage, our results demonstrate that STEM imaging at magnifications up to <italic>M</italic> = 28,000 <italic>x</italic> allows for visualization of magnetosome structures while retaining an intact bacterial cell membrane. The electron doses used in this study are below that for radiation damage of the bacterial ultrastructure, so imaging of the magnetosome nanostructures in a native cellular environment is possible. High resolution TEM (HRTEM) of intact magnetosome structures in the fluid cell is also possible (cf. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supp. Fig. S1</xref>); however, the high electron dose will quickly kill the cells and damage the ultrastructure. One possibility is to perform a fluid cell HRTEM or HRSTEM study where the various steps of magnetosome growth are imaged subsequently in several cells, so that each image of a growing magnetosome is taken from a bacterial cell that is alive up to the moment of imaging. Previous studies have shown that exposure of magnetotactic bacteria to different types of radiation can affect magnetosome shape and size through direct DNA damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. We didn't observe any direct damage to the magnetosomes by the electron beam in this work and there are no studies on the effect of electrons on magnetosome growth, but possible changes in the magnetosome structure due to high energy electron irradiation should be considered. Another possible route for this technique is <italic>in situ</italic> chemical imaging of soluble iron uptake by magnetotactic bacteria. We have recently visualized iron binding by micelles of bacterial membrane protein by observing the increase in Z-contrast of the micelles <italic>via</italic> fluid cell HAADF-STEM imaging<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. This study indicates this technique shows promise for visualizing uptake of iron into the bacteria. <italic>In situ</italic> spectral imaging <italic>via</italic> EELS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref> or energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref> mapping may provide additional means for visualizing iron uptake, which has only been possible to date in dried bacteria samples using techniques like scanning transmission x-ray microscopy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>. Finally, further correlative fluorescence and fluid cell electron microscopy studies utilizing fluorescent proteins could allow investigation of the connections between biomolecular processes and biomineralization of magnetosome magnetite nanocrystals. For instance, fluorescently tagged membrane proteins can be tracked during bacterial cell growth <italic>via</italic> fluorescence microscopy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, followed by fluid cell STEM imaging of the magnetosome structures to aid in elucidating the role of protein localization in the biomineralization process.</p><p>In summary, cells of <italic>M.</italic>
<italic>magneticum</italic> strain AMB-1 were fluorescently labeled with SYTO 9 and propidium iodide nucleic acid stains and imaged in media <italic>via</italic> fluid cell STEM and fluorescence microscopy. The magnetite magnetosomes provided high contrast labels to image bacterial cells using HAADF-STEM; in some cases the bacterial cell membrane was resolved when the liquid layer was sufficiently thin. We established the major cellular damage sources to be electron beam irradiation and compression of the bacteria between the SiN windows. The STEM electron dose could be kept sufficiently low to prevent detectable ultrastructure damage to bacteria. However, at high electron doses (&#x0003e;1.0 electron<bold>&#x000b7;</bold>&#x000c5;<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and after multiple STEM exposures), radiation damage in the bacterial cytoplasm was manifested as a contraction of the magnetosome chain length. Correlative fluorescence and STEM imaging indicated that cells of <italic>M. magneticum</italic> had intact membranes after STEM irradiation in the fluid cell, but could not establish other cell viability criteria such as reproductive ability or enzymatic function. We found that ~50% of the cells typically had intact membranes upon assembling the fluid cell, and approximately half of these bacteria sustained membrane damage due to compressive stresses over the next two hours in the fluid cell. This correlative fluid cell STEM and fluorescence microscopy technique is a first step in directly observing biomineralization of magnetite in viable magnetotactic bacteria. We expect this technique to be generally applicable for <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of a wide range of biomineralizing organisms.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Preparation of cells of <italic>M. magneticum</italic></title><p>Cells of <italic>M. magneticum</italic> were grown in a 5&#x02005;ml flask in standard media at room temperature under microaerobic conditions (approximately 1% O<sub>2</sub> in the headspace)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>.

Briefly, a thin liquid layer (typically 100&#x02013;500&#x02005;nm thick) was formed by sandwiching two SiN coated silicon chips with a 50 &#x000d7; 200&#x02005;&#x000b5;m opening etched from the center. The 50&#x02005;nm thick SiN is electron transparent and spans the etch pit in the chip center, creating an imaging window to observe the bacterial cells in the thin liquid layer. The liquid layer and silicon chips are then hermetically sealed to prevent evaporation of the liquid (more details on liquid cell holders for electron microscopy can be found in a previous review paper<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>).</p><p>In a typical experiment, the bacterial cells were attached to one of two types of fluid cell chips: SiN chips with 100&#x02005;nm thick SU-8 spacers (Hummingbird Scientific, Lacey, WA, USA) or BioPlus biofunctionalized blank SiN chips with no spacers (Dune Sciences and Hummingbird Scientific, Lacey, WA, USA). The BioPlus chips are functionalized with a surface coating that renders them positively charged, encouraging attachment of bacterial cells. In some cases, SiN spacer chips were coated with poly-L-lysine or (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) to render them hydrophilic, positively charged, and encourage attachment of the cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>. To coat a SiN window with poly-L-lysine, the chip was floated SiN side down on a film of 0.1% w/v aqueous poly-l-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5&#x02005;min, then floated on DI water (Milli-Q grade, 18.2&#x02005;M&#x003a9;) for 1&#x02005;min, and finally dried with air. To coat a SiN window with APTES (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), the window was cleaned by rinsing in toluene and anhydrous ethanol and then dried under nitrogen. The window was then cleaned in UV/O<sub>3</sub> plasma (Bioforce Nanosciences, Ames, IA, USA) for 45&#x02005;min, followed by APTES functionalization using established protocols<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>.</p><p>To deposit the cells on a SiN spacer chip, the spacer and a blank chip were first treated in UV/O<sub>3</sub> plasma for 30&#x02005;min to clean and render them hydrophilic.

Excess liquid was then removed from the chip using filter paper and the chip was sandwiched on top of a blank chip in the fluid cell holder. This inverted deposition technique encourages preferential attachment of live motile cells, as dead cells likely settle down to the Parafilm by gravity and do not attach. The BioPlus, APTES, and poly-L-lysine chips were used without UV/O<sub>3</sub> plasma cleaning to preserve the surface functionality, and cells were deposited by drop casting 0.75&#x02005;&#x000b5;L of the concentrated bacteria culture on the SiN chip.
