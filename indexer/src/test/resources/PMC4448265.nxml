This is based on a multidimensional version of the Unified Colored Noise Approximation. By comparing theory with numerical simulations we demonstrate that the theoretical probability density quantitatively describes the accumulation of active particles around repulsive obstacles. In particular, for two particles with repulsive interactions, the probability of close contact decreases when one of the two particle is pinned. Moreover, in the case of isotropic confining potentials, the radial density profile shows a non trivial scaling with radius. Finally we show that the theory well approximates the &#x0201c;pressure&#x0201d; generated by the active particles allowing to derive an equation of state for a system of non-interacting colored noise-driven particles.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>A generic system, that is in thermal equilibrium at a temperature <italic>T</italic>, will be found in the neighbourhood of a configuration of energy <italic>E</italic> with a probability density given by the the Boltzmann factor exp[&#x02212; <italic>E</italic>/<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>T</italic>]<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. As an example, two Brownian colloidal particles, interacting through a conservative attractive force, will show an increased probability density for the low energy bound state. A quite different behaviour is observed in active particle systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Generally speaking, active matter is composed by biological or synthetic objects that are capable of absorbing energy from the environment and convert it into different kinds of persistent motions. Even when stationary states are reached, the probability distributions can display large deviations from their equilibrium Boltzmann counterparts. Those deviations are not just a matter of quantity, but a radically different qualitative behaviour may be observed, like the widespread tendency to accumulate around repulsive objects. This &#x0201c;attraction for repulsion&#x0201d; is responsible for phenomena like, particle accumulation at solid walls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> or the formation of bound states between repulsive objects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Our intuitive notion that particles like to stay where external forces attract them to is biased by our familiarity with equilibrium statistical mechanics and needs to be replaced by novel statistical mechanics concepts that are capable to describe the stationary probability distributions in systems of interacting active particles. In this context some schematic models have been proposed to model the dynamics of active particles as, for example, the &#x0201c;run and tumble&#x0201d; (RnT) model. The RnT dynamics is appropriate to describe the motion of bacteria such as <italic>E. coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> that swim along almost straight runs interrupted by random reorientations. In the case of colloids propelled by chemical reactions the &#x0201c;active Brownian&#x0201d; model describes the motion of particles pushed by a force of constant magnitude that gradually reorient by rotational Brownian motion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. However, despite the simplicity of the dynamics of these systems, it is hardly possible to find the analogue of the Boltzmann distribution. Indeed, the Boltzmann prescription assigns a precise weight to a given configuration of positions and momenta of particles at equilibrium. These particles are embedded in a space of dimensionality <italic>d</italic>, are subject to arbitrary external fields and mutually interact via whatsoever potential<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. On the contrary, in the case of active particles the exact stationary probability distribution is known only in rare instances as, for example, in the 1-dimensional RnT model in an external force field<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The impossibility of writing explicitly the stationary probability density prevents one from applying the standard methods of statistical mechanics. A Gaussian colored-noise model (GCN) can be used to reproduce the dynamics of passive colloidal particles immersed in a bath of dense swimming bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. This model has been intensively studied in the past as the simplest model that could elucidate the basic physics of systems subject to time-correlated noise. Interestingly GCN was originally used to interpret the behaviour of very different physical systems such as noisy electronic circuits<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> and dye-laser radiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. The analytical study of GCN-driven systems resulted very challenging and led to the development of different approximation schemes aimed to reduce the complexity of the GCN-model to a tractable level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Among these approaches one emerges by having a number of advantages with respect to the others. This is the <italic>Unified Colored Noise Approximation</italic> (UCNA) developed by H&#x000e4;nggi and Jung<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> that, under certain conditions, describes both the small and the large correlation-time regimes, both in the high and low-friction limit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. More importantly for the present work the UCNA scheme can be generalized to a phase space of arbitrary dimensionality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. In this work we report, for the first time, the explicit formula of the stationary probability (obtained within the UCNA) for a system that is subject to a generic conservative potential and that is composed by an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom. We name this &#x0201c;multidimensional unified colored noise approximated stationary probability&#x0201d; (MUCNASP). The MUCNASP plays basically the same role as the Boltzmann distribution for the approximated GCN-driven system. We show how the MUCNASP allows to predict several non-equilibrium properties of the active system in experimentally relevant cases where a simple external potential acts on a small number of degrees of freedom. We focus on the case of steep repulsive interactions and spherically symmetric external potentials. In all these situations we use numerical simulation to test the quality of the approximation and find that the GCN-driven and the RnT particles display a strikingly similar behavior. In particular we show how our approximated probability density captures very well the accumulation of the active particles around repulsive obstacles. Moreover the theory describes well the dependence on dimensionality of the probability density function when the active particles are confined by a circular repulsive wall. Understanding how the concept of pressure generalizes to active matter has become recently the subject of intense theoretical research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In this context we show how our theoretical probability density allows us to derive the pressure that the active particles exert on the repulsive walls and leads to the derivation of equations of state for the non-interacting active particle system. Finally we discuss the most relevant limitations of the present theory and suggest new routes to follow in the theoretical study of active matter.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We consider the following set of stochastic differential equations:<disp-formula id="eq1"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e239" xlink:href="srep10742-m1.jpg"/></disp-formula>where the position variables <italic><bold>x</bold></italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;(<italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub>,&#x02026;,<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub>) are determined by the deterministic velocity &#x02212; &#x02207;&#x003a6; generated by a conservative potential &#x003a6;(<bold>x</bold>) and by a set of stochastic processes <italic><bold>&#x003b7;</bold></italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;(<italic>&#x003b7;</italic><sub>1</sub>,&#x02026;,<italic>&#x003b7;</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub>).

(4)</xref> with <italic>&#x003c4;</italic> replaced by 2<italic>&#x003c4;</italic>. This is at variance with equilibrium statistical mechanics in which the probability of finding two particles at a given distance does not vary if one of the two particles is pinned at some fixed position<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. To be more specific let us consider a repulsive potential of the form &#x003a6;(<italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>x</italic><sub>2</sub>)&#x02009;=&#x02009;(<italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub> &#x02212; <italic>x</italic><sub>2</sub>)<sup>&#x02212;12</sup>. In this case again the probability is well described by the MUCNASP as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1(b)</xref>. Similarly the deterministic velocity component experienced by one particle &#x02329;|&#x003a6;<italic>'</italic>|&#x0232a; resulting from simulations is well approximated by the theory (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1(c</xref>). Again, in the limit of an infinitely steep potential (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Material</xref>), we find that the area of the peak of &#x003a9;(&#x00394;<italic>x</italic>) is approximated by <inline-formula id="d33e855"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e856" xlink:href="srep10742-m16.jpg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula id="d33e858"><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d33e859" xlink:href="srep10742-m17.jpg"/></inline-formula> which is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1(c)</xref> as a dashed line. This can be physically interpreted as follows: when both particles are free to move they can be more often found in contact since they move coherently in the same direction, this happens without the particles pushing onto each other, yielding a lower value of the average interaction force. It is important to note that these theoretical results cannot be derived analytically in the RnT model since the coupled dynamics of more particles makes the problem far too complicated. Nevertheless we have found that the MUCNASP produces results for the average &#x02329;|&#x003a6;<italic>'</italic>|&#x0232a; that are very similar those found numerically for the RnT model despite the stationary probability density has a very different form (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Material</xref>). This suggests that the MUCNASP can be used as a convenient approximation also for calculating the averages in RnT dynamics at least in the case of steeply repulsive potentials. Note also that such a scenario is in agreement with the findings of Ref.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> where it was demonstrated, by combining experiments and simulations, that two colloids suspended in a bacterial bath tend to stay in contact because of the colored-noise forces induced by swimming bacteria.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Radially symmetric potentials</title><p>When the <italic>d</italic>-dimensional potential is spherically symmetric, i.e. &#x003a6;(<bold>x</bold>)&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x003a6;(<italic>r</italic>), <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq18">Eq.

An experimental situation, that is close to the spherically symmetric case treated here, has been recently studied<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. In these experiments it was observed a marked accumulation of swimming bacteria at the border of spherical liquid droplets. In this kind of experiment it would be interesting to check whether, in the dilute regime, the number of bacteria found in contact with the border scales with the droplet radius and the characteristic run length as predicted by the MUCNASP (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq18">Eq. (6)</xref>) in the spherical case.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>By using the unified colored noise approximation, we have derived the explicit formula for the non-equilibrium stationary probability (MUCNASP, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq18">Eq. (3)</xref>) of a system composed by an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom subject to GCN. We have focused onto the case of steep repulsive potentials where the probability distribution of one single active particle tends to concentrate on the repulsive part of the potential oppositely to the case of a Brownian particle. Moreover we have verified that, as predicted by the MUCNASP, two active particles interacting repulsively behave differently with respect to equilibrium and are found in contact more often than if one particle is fixed. Finally the MUCNASP predicts that, when active particles are confined inside a repulsive ring-shaped barrier, the probability peaks on the boundary and the area of this peak increases with increasing radius and with increasing persistence length. Surprisingly the results obtained by the MUCNASP are very close to those obtained for RnT particles for which an analytical solution is not available. As discussed before<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, the UCNA is accurate in those portions of phase space where the all the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix are positive. This restriction defines where <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq18">Eq. (3)</xref> can be used as a valid approximation for the probability of GCN-driven system. Moreover it appears difficult to derive an explicitly formula for probability including also Brownian fluctuations. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, the MUCNASP is the only available explicit probability formula accounting for multiple active degrees of freedom and, provided that all eigenvalues are positive, becomes exact both in the limit of <italic>&#x003c4;</italic> &#x02192; 0 and <italic>&#x003c4;</italic> &#x02192; &#x0221e;. This makes the MUCNASP a valuable schematic model for tackling the many-body problem in active matter. For example it would be interesting to check whether, at the mean-field level, the MUCNASP can predict a motility-induced phase separation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> or the colored-noise induced shift in the synchronization threshold of the noisy Kuramoto model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Maggi, C. <italic>et al.</italic> Multidimensional Stationary Probability Distribution for Interacting Active Particles. <italic>Sci.
