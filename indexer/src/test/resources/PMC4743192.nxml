Carcinoma cells at invasive front frequently show aberrant gene expression, and dedifferentiate into mesenchymal cell-like states in a process of disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition, sustained proliferation is another prominent feature in an aggressive subset of carcinomas. Proliferation and differentiation balance of cells control development and homeostasis of epithelium and play a definitive role in pathological state of carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. They are largely regulated by tumor suppressive gene, and expression of the genes is frequently inactivated by epigenetic mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is important to unveil a cause inactivating tumor suppressive gene expression to understand mechanisms of oral carcinoma progression.</p><p>In stratified squamous epithelium including oral epithelium, kr&#x000fc;ppel-like factor (KLF) 4 and 5 are expressed in post-mitotic keratinizing suprabasal cells and proliferative less-differentiated basal cells, respectively. They critically control a proliferation-differentiation balance of the epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. KLFs transcriptionally regulate target gene expression through binding on the promoter, and previous studies documented that loss of KLF4 expression associates with dedifferentiation of oral carcinoma cells and is frequently observed in an aggressive subset of the carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It suggests an involvement of the loss of expression in carcinoma progression.</p><p>Since chromosomal deletion of <italic>KLF4</italic> gene locus at 9q31.2 is a rare event in carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], epigenetic inactivation of the gene is a prime candidate responsible for the loss of expression. Among epigenetic aberrations found in carcinoma cells, promoter hypermethylation is a most common causative to inactivate gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In fact, hypermethylation at <italic>KLF4</italic> gene promoter and enhancer is documented in carcinomas of the colon, stomach, cervix and kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, the hypermethylated regions are variably localized in carcinomas of different origin and unknown in oral carcinomas. In this study, we analyzed the hypermethylation and correlation with KLF4 expression in oral carcinoma cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Oral carcinoma cell lines (Ca9.22, Ho-1-u-1, HOC313, HSC2, HSC3, KOSC3, OSC19, SCCKN, TSU) and an immortalized but not transformed normal keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], were cultured in 10&#x000a0;% fetal bovine serum-containing medium.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Bisulfite-modified sequence analysis of <italic>KLF4</italic> promoter region</title><p>Promoter methylation states at <italic>KLF4</italic> gene were analyzed according to a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

KLF4 expression is decreased in many types of carcinomas in advanced stage and the loss of expression initiates epithelial-mesenchymal transition of carcinoma cells that strongly stimulates the progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In fact KLF4 is down-regulated in less-differentiated and advanced oral carcinomas and suppresses dedifferentiation of the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although the promoter hypermethylation is considered as a cause of the loss of expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], it is not known in oral carcinomas. This study shows that the expression closely correlates with hypermethylation states at a 239&#x000a0;bp-region in the promoter.</p><p>Hypermethylation responsible for gene inactivation is frequently observed in CpG islands of tumor suppressive genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and it was shown in <italic>KLF4</italic> gene in this study, suggesting that the region is important to regulate KLF4 expression in oral carcinoma cells. This is supported by that demethylation treatment up-regulated KLF4 mRNA and protein in the hypermethylated cells but not the cells without hypermethylation. Ca9.22 cells, Ho-1-u-1 cells and OSC19 cells that were not hypermethylated almost did not increase the expression. It suggests a presence of additional factors to activate the expression. However, it is clear that the hypermethylation is responsible for KLF4 down-regulation, and that the 237&#x000a0;bp-region may play an important role in the expression.</p><p>Hypermethylation of <italic>KLF4</italic> gene is happened at enhancer of the gene in human malignant tumor cells; &#x02212;2,128&#x02009;~&#x02009;&#x02212;1,770 region in medulloblastoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;1,852&#x02009;~&#x02009;&#x02212;1,658 region in cervical carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although we did not addressed methylation at the enhancer in this study, methylation at promoter region is more directly as a platform to regulate gene expression in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Hypermethylation at <italic>KLF4</italic> gene promoter has been observed in gastric carcinoma cells (&#x02212;130&#x02009;~&#x02009;&#x02212;13 region; ref. 14) and in colorectal carcinoma cells (+79&#x02009;~&#x02009;+355 region; ref. 13), but the&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;481&#x02009;~&#x02009;+192 region was not methylated in this study. It indicates that hypermethylation restricted at a 237-bp region from&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;718 to&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;482 is important for the negative regulation in oral carcinoma cells. Recent evidences established that hypermethylation occurs at different region of gene promoter/enhancer in different types of carcinoma cells and the promoter hypermethylation is more designate for cell-lineage and cell-type specification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It is plausible that the hypermethylation-sensitive sites in oral carcinoma cells locate apart from other-types of carcinoma cells.</p><p>The 237-bp region encodes Sp1 and PU.1 binding sites that are required for the expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

Therefore, hypermethylation at the 237-bp region appears to have a significant role in KLF4 down-regulation. Since loss of KLF4 expression closely associates with oral carcinoma progression, restoring the expression may be an intriguing strategy to treat the patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrated that <italic>KLF4</italic> gene promoter was hypermethylated in oral carcinoma cells at a different region from other-types of carcinoma cells, and that it was associated with KLF4 expression.
