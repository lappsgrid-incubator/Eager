scientific json provided by research - therefore, research becomes an undeniable
instrument to solve the diversity of questions about how to achieve the universality of
care health<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<sup>)</sup> - the present investigation formulated the following question: What are the
characteristics of the nursing contribution in terms of scientific production, subjects
and events of interest, regarding coverage, access and universal health equity? Two
conceptual references were used to answer this question: universal health coverage and
bibliometrics. </p><p>Universal coverage or universal health coverage consists of the development of health
financing systems that enable all people to have access to health services, including
advocacy, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation activities, and that their having
access incurs no financial difficulties for them in terms of paying for those services.
In other words, it involves solving how the health system is financed, how it protects
people from the financial consequences that facing an illness brings to them for the
needed care, as well as how the resources available in that system are optimally
used<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<sup>-</sup>
<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Thus two other essential concepts arise: access and equity. Universal
access in health means an absence of geographic, economic, sociocultural, and
organizational or gender barriers, and this is achieved through the progressive removal
of barriers that prevent people from using all comprehensive health services, determined
equitably and at a national level<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. In turn, universal health equity is a broad, inclusive, and
multidimensional concept, consisting of aspects related to achieving good health through
processes that not only have to do with the distribution of health care, but also with
social justice and non-discrimination in the delivery of such care<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Health is not only a function of the health sector; in order to achieve
it, other factors such as living conditions and working conditions, psychosocial factors
and socioeconomic status are involved<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. In other words, universal equity in health means achieving health without
any social circumstance to prevent it<sup>(5).</sup>
</p><p>Once the conceptual contribution of the study was determined, a bibliometric analysis
was used for characterization because, while it allows us to look back at how scientific
advances have been achieved and released, it also reveals the generation of useful
results and measures the development of scientific disciplines on certain research
lines<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Bibliometric indicators of production quantify both the number of
documents published, by country, institution and authors, as well as the citations of
those documents as a measure of their impact or importance<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. These are measurements obtained from the statistical analysis of the basic
elements of journals or articles with which indicators are built to measure the quality,
impact, relationships or collaboration and scientific activity, i.e., the quantification
and temporal evolution of the production<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<sup>)</sup> . Thus, the information stored in databases represents raw material which,
once analyzed, allows for the extraction of knowledge that can contribute to
understanding scientific efforts and making strategic decisions in a particular field of
knowledge<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. </p><p>Based on the information above, this study had two objectives: first, to characterize
the scientific contribution of nursing in coverage, universal access and equity in
health through bibliometric indicators; and, second, to understand the trends of this
production in terms of studied subjects and phenomena .</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The type of study and unit of analyze was: bibliometric, descriptive and exploratory
research, whose unit of analysis was serial publications and documents recovered from
the category, "Nursing", in the Web of Science, henceforth WOS. </p><p>Search strategies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>) were: a consultation
of DeCS (Descriptors in Health Sciences) and MeSH (Medical Subject Heading) thesaurus
was conducted to recover those controlled terms or descriptors that were related to the
natural terms of the research problem, i.e. "coverage", "access" and "equity", and each
separately associated with the terms "health", "health care", "health services" and
"universal". </p><p>

</p><p>The universe consisted of: 97 magazines and 410 documents (articles, reviews, letters,
notes, editorials, etc.). Data analysis used was: frequency distribution and measures of
central tendency and dispersion for exploratory univariate analysis of unidimensional or
descriptive bibliometric indicators. For the behavior of authors and journals, the laws
of Lotka and Bradford were calculated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Document characteristics</title><p>Magnitude, evolution and document types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure
2</xref>): registration of documents in the WOS starting in the 1990s, with an
article, reaching an average of 47.5, from 2011 on. By 2015, there were already a
total of 410 records. According to the type of documents, in the 25 years studied,
91.5% (375) were articles, 3.7% (15) were reviews and 2.2% (9) were editorials. The
rest were brief reports, news, and letters to the editor. </p><p>

</p><p>Collaboration: only 31% of this production (127) had institutional collaboration; the
most common partnership (27) was university/hospital. The rate of collaboration or
co-authorship, i.e., the average number of authors per paper, throughout the period
was 3.5. The highest value was obtained by a co-authored article from
2007,<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<sup>)</sup> with 12 Canadian authors, which described how the real-time access that
hospital or community nurses had to electronic resources could not only obtain
information simultaneously about patient results or about the best evidence to
support the practice, but also revealed the close relationship between nursing
interventions and patient outcomes. This is a key issue in planning the best
interventions in a timely manner, and thereby facilitates access to better health
care in the short term<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Collaboration at a national level exceeded this indicator in 93.4% of
the manuscripts (383), of which, the document with the highest number of authors'
participating affiliations was from 2009, in which nine academic Australian
philanthropic, research and care institutions were identified; their purpose was to
conduct a mapping of rural and regional cancer services in that country. Among other
things, significant deficiencies in the provision of oncological services, limited
availability of nurses, and significant differences in their training to provide
similar care were identified. It was concluded that these deficiencies could
contribute to disadvantage the progress of cancer patients living in regional, rural
and remote areas, and that it was imperative to take short-term measures to improve
access to better oncological services and thereby eliminate inequalities in the care
of these patients in Australia<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. International collaboration only reached 7%, led by the United States,
with ten publications along with European, Asian, African and Latin American
countries. Notable in this group was a manuscript, with the increased presence of
participating countries, with authors from England, Norway, Australia, Switzerland,
Germany and Greece. It was a review published in 2013, from 16 studies, describing
the perceptions, needs and experiences of pregnant migrant women. It was concluded
that although all member states of the European Union had ratified resolutions based
on human rights, a connection remained between social inequality and barriers to
accessing pre-, intra- and post-partum care. The results showed that migrant women
were a very vulnerable group during pregnancy and childbirth, and it was necessary to
improve access to health services to better meet their actual needs<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. </p><p>Authors, occasional production and Lotka law: 1197 authors were identified in all of
the papers. Of these, 1109 had only one article, so the occasional production or
transience rate was 93%. Because of this ratio, we could not get a predictable
standard distribution of authors and studies. In accordance with the foregoing, by
calculating the Lotka coefficient (-3.4), it was found that the community of authors
in regards to coverage, universal access and health equity in the WOS Nursing
category remains a community of researchers with poor scientific productivity,
represented by an elite group of 34 researchers (&#x0221a;1197) who have written three or
more papers. Herein, the author Tereza Cristina Scatena Villa stands out, who heads
the elite as a co-author of nine articles published from 2011 to 2014, which cover
various topics regarding accessibility to tuberculosis care services.</p><p>Quotations: visibility index, i.e., the relative weight that had the number of
citable documents (articles, reviews, letters and notes), in this case 394, which
were cited during the period, was 67.7% (267). It seemed important to investigate the
behavior of scientific citation by scientific category, given that 118 of the citable
documents (29.9%) were linked to one or more of the 18 categories found, other than
"Nursing". <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref> shows the average citation
per category. The highest average number of citation (7.7) reached up to six
documents, related to the Obstetrics &#x00026; Gynecology categories, followed by two
related to Public, Environment &#x00026; Occupational Health and thirdly, those linked to
Cardiology &#x00026; Cardiovascular System. The Nursing category, in the 25 years
studied, ranked fourth with an average of six citations for 394 documents. </p><p>

</p></sec><sec><title>Study subjects and phenomena</title><p>To monitor trends on topics of interest, it seemed important to retrieve and analyze,
by years, the most cited documents separated by scientific categories, and separate
from them the phenomena and study subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f03">Figure
3</xref>). A total of 15 categories in the 394 scientific papers, and 14 citable
documents with the highest number of citations by category were identified. In the
most cited group, a 2005 review with 286 citations supporting the Nursing category is
highlighted.</p><p>

</p><p>In the UK, based on growing American evidence that men seek help to solve several
health problems, such as depression, substance abuse, physical disabilities or
stressful life events less frequently than women and that men were more reluctant to
seek help and access health services, there was a need to retrieve scientific
literature to describe such behavior. A growing number of gender studies were found
that showed a tendency for men to delay seeking help when they got sick. Under this
approach, white middle-class men, for example, had a<italic>traditional male
behavior</italic> that prevented them from accessing timely health care. It was
concluded that, primarily, the role of male beliefs and the similarities and
differences between different male profiles required more attention and research;
especially taking into account health inequalities that existed between men of
different socio-economic status and ethnicity. The authors suggested further research
with heterogeneous samples to obtain a better understanding of the triggers and
barriers associated with the process of making decisions about men seeking care
health. They emphasized that, with more evidence, not only could it improve the
access of men to health care, but it would also improve the quality of life of the
women who informally have to take over that care, and therefore also reduce national
health costs associated with delayed health care<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. </p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion and conclusions</title><p>It is worth highlighting that the entry of Scielo and KCI-Korean collections in the Web
of Science enables the performance of global bibliometric studies, in order to observe
the behavior of particular scientific fields and study phenomena. While it is arguable
that this study does not include everything the nursing community has produced regarding
coverage, access and universal equity in health, from WOS, we can separate the
collection of documents with the best scientific quality about the subject, and have an
overview of their contribution. </p><p>With respect to documents, specifically regarding the evolution of magnitude, it is
clearly shown that the issue has not entered the phase of linear growth. This is a
characteristic that lends to investigative work with a scientific maturity of an area of
knowledge, even if the 25-year period studied was enough to strengthen this line of
research. Evidence that reinforces this includes the small amount of retrieved reviews
(3.7%) and primarily national collaboration (93.4%) which originated from the university
environment with high levels of transience. This coincides with the point made by
Trzesniak<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<sup>)</sup> to establish that nursing, as with other emerging sciences, is still in
transition from technology/profession into science/research, and the behavior of the
group that has researched coverage, access and equity in health, proves it. </p><p>It is remarkable that, despite the increased productivity originating in countries such
as the USA and UK, it is a Brazilian author that leads the productivity rates by author.
Indeed, Scatena Villa has had a continuing involvement over time with nine articles that
may well represent a research subline regarding coverage, access and equity in patients
with tuberculosis.</p><p>The visibility achieved by the citable documents (67%) is also important, and almost 30%
are categorized in other scientific fields, indicating that those papers produced by
Nursing on the issue not only impact its own group, but also contribute to the knowledge
of other scientific areas<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<sup>)</sup> .</p><p>Regarding the journals, it is expected that countries with a lot of json in the WOS
occupy the greatest amount of indexed journals, which makes it more relevant that Brazil
is integrated into the group of core journals, and ranks third with seven journals which
accumulate 72 full text documents with free access. No doubt, this free access
incorporated into a global database such as the WOS could be called<italic>global
scientific accessibility</italic>. This is a key and important feature in order to
ethically meet universal health coverage. Without access to relevant science produced
around the world, one cannot speak of universality or coverage or access, and, even
less, of equity in health. </p><p>Regarding the featured articles, either in collaboration or citations, the set of
documents indicates that nursing has understood very well the concepts of coverage,
access and universal equity in health. The fact that the study subjects are elderly in
rural areas, cancer patients, patients with psychiatric illnesses, pregnant migrant
women, homeless adults, children living in slums, adult men hospitalized or unwilling to
access health care, and many other types of groups, reflects an understanding of the
need to progressively remove all barriers that prevent people from using the
comprehensive health services, organized by the countries to which they
belong<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Likewise, the fact that the research phenomena most frequently cited
related to decision-making in health, use of health services, factors affecting
diagnostics, mean usage, user satisfaction, attitudes of nursing students confronting
vulnerable groups, or use of computer networks and tools to educate or connect the
family with the inpatient, indicate that nursing seeks, through its research, those
niches of inequality and inequity in care as a mechanism to clearly observe reality and
reduce those gaps that impede universality in health care. </p><p>Although neither the methodological framework nor the theoretical research in the study
were part of this investigation, we observed a variety of qualitative and quantitative
approaches to solve research problems, and the gender perspective as a fundamental
perspective to build knowledge in this area. Gender and universal coverage, access and
equity in health care perspectives have their fundamental livelihood in human rights and
ethics.</p><p>It is a fact that the worldwide nursing community already has core journals in the area,
but there remains a need to strengthen future research by better organizing it in terms
of research lines and sub lines, internationalization, and creating a close link between
academia, now linked to nursing, which is developed at a community level.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B01"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Organizaci&#x000f3;n Mundial de la Salud (OMS)</collab></person-group><source>Informe sobre la salud en el mundo 2013: Investigaciones para una cobertura
