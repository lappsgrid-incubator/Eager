Mechanisms mediating the adverse effect of stress on CVD risk include exaggerated or dysregulated immune activation in response to psychosocial stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Acute mental stress elicited using behavioral or cognitive tasks is known to up-regulate pro-inflammatory gene expression in peripheral mononuclear blood cells resulting in the synthesis and release of inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Evidence shows that the binding activity of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB), a key mediator of inducible transcription in the immune system and inflammatory genes, is enhanced by exposure to acute stress in humans. This is likely mediated through adrenergic receptor stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and appears to be inversely related to glucocorticoid responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>In humans, elevation in inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1&#x003b2;) can be detected in peripheral blood as early as 30&#x000a0;min following stress and may continue to rise up to 2&#x000a0;h and more after stress exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Interestingly, there appear to be robust individual differences in the magnitude and pattern of inflammatory stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, inflammatory responses do not seem to habituate to repeated exposure to acute stress; in other words, inflammatory responses sensitize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This suggests that over time, continued exposure to stress-induced inflammatory responses to psychosocial stress may up-regulate low-grade, peripheral inflammation. Up-regulation of inflammatory activity may ultimately lead to greater risk of developing inflammatory-related diseases or the exacerbation of existing ones. However, apart from two studies showing positive associations between stress-induced inflammatory responses at baseline and inflammation-related CV risk factors 3&#x000a0;years later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], prospective evidence supporting the hypotheses of inflammatory responses linked to inflammation-related disease risk is scarce.</p><p>Sex differences in pro-inflammatory responses to acute mental stress have been reported in some studies, but the evidence is inconclusive. Greater IL-6 and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) responses in females 45&#x000a0;min post-stress compared to males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] have been previously observed. However, null and contradictory findings have also been reported. Stress-induced IL-6 responses to the paced auditory serial addition task were significantly greater in males 30&#x000a0;min post-stress in a small study of individuals aged 21&#x000a0;years on average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Yet, no differences were observed at 60&#x000a0;min post-stress exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Pro-inflammatory cytokine production has also been examined by evaluating changes in vitro following stimulation of white blood cells using immunogens such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Although in vitro responses and changes in non-stimulated levels likely involve different mechanisms, examining sex differences in stimulated inflammatory responses may also be relevant. A study of inflammatory responses to LPS in 294 young individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] reported no sex differences in stimulated IL-6 reactivity. However, males had higher C-reactive protein (CRP) responses compared to females. Yet, another study in an older sample found no sex differences in stimulated IL-6 responses to a 5-min speech task 30&#x000a0;min post-stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, in a subgroup analysis the authors observed that post-menopausal females had greater IL-6 responses compared to pre-menopausal females. This finding indicates that menopausal status may account for some of the inconsistencies observed among previous studies. Reasons for these inconsistencies may also be attributable to differences in the stress stimuli used (socially evaluative versus cognitive or in vitro stimulation), small sample sizes that do not allow sex-specific analyses, inadequate or limited post-stress blood sampling, and failure to include important covariates.</p><p>Sex differences in inflammatory stress responsivity may be expected because, in general, females exhibit greater sympathoadrenal responsiveness compared to males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In addition, given that sex hormones are implicated in the glucocorticoid response to acute stress, and that females generally produce greater stress hormones when in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], changes in hormonal output associated with aging suggest that sex difference in inflammatory stress responses may more consistently emerge in older participants. Heightened pro-inflammatory stress responses may therefore be a relevant sex-specific risk marker in middle- and older-aged individuals, but most previous studies have mainly included young subjects.</p><p>Since several inflammatory-related conditions are more prevalent in older populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], identifying sex differences in pro-inflammatory stress responses in the post-menopausal stage may be important for preventive strategies. Accordingly, the aim of this analysis was to examine sex differences in IL-6 responses to mental stress in a large sample of healthy, post-menopausal women, and men. We hypothesized that (I) mild behavioral stress would elicit substantial IL-6 increases between baseline and 75&#x000a0;min post-stress, and (II) females would exhibit significantly greater IL-6 responses throughout the stress protocol compared to males, and (III) this sex difference would survive adjustment for relevant covariates that are related to either sex or inflammatory stress responses.</p><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Participants&#x02019; Characteristics</title><p>Healthy participants drawn from the Whitehall II epidemiological cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] were invited to take part in a parent study examining the role of psychophysiologic factors in CVD risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Exclusion criteria included objective signs of clinical or subclinical CVD, cancer treatment in the past 5&#x000a0;years, regular use of prescribed medications (excluding statins), current hypertension, any inflammatory or autoimmune conditions, and diagnosed mental health disorders. These criteria were verified through review of clinical json from previous phases of the Whitehall II study.

Briefly, in the mirror tracing task, participants were required to trace the narrow contour of a star using an electronic stylus while looking at the star&#x02019;s reflection in a mirror.

Participant&#x02019;s height and weight were measured using a stadiometer and a Tanita digital scale, and BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was computed. Waist circumference was measured using a metal anthropometric tape midway between the lowest rib and iliac crest. Fat mass was estimated with a segmental body composition analyzer (Tanita BC-418) using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Participants were subsequently escorted to a light- and temperature-controlled stress laboratory where a venous cannula was inserted into the antecubital fossa of the non-dominant arm for repeated blood sampling. Following a 30-min rest, a 2-mL baseline blood sample was drawn into EDTA containing Vacutainer and the cannula was flushed with saline solution. Mental stress was then administered with the researcher present in the room; a second blood sample was drawn immediately after the two tasks. Participants entered the stress recovery period and were allowed to read nature magazines or watch nature DVDs.

Consistent with most previous reports, baseline IL-6 levels were associated with older age, greater adiposity levels, and higher depressive symptoms score and inversely with socioeconomic position and frequency of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. We observed an increase (31&#x000a0;%) in circulating levels of IL-6 in response to mild acute stress in the whole sample, with values not returning toward baseline even at 75&#x000a0;min post-stress (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p>Our main hypothesis was supported. Female participants exhibited significantly greater responses at 45 and 75&#x000a0;min post-stress, and this effect was independent of age, adiposity, socioeconomic position, depressive symptoms, physical activity and alcohol consumption, smoking status, lipid lowering drug use, time of testing, subjective stress and task appraisal, hormone replacement therapy use, and resting IL-6 levels. The findings reported here are consistent with a previous report that showed greater inflammatory stress responses in women 45&#x000a0;min post-stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Yet, the inflammatory responses observed in this study were of greater magnitude and were also sustained 75&#x000a0;min after stress exposure. This finding also adds support to a previous small study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] that found sex differences in LPS-stimulated IL-6 production at 30&#x000a0;min post-stress between post-menopausal women compared to pre-menopausal women, and men. However, in that study, mental stress-related changes in unstimulated IL-6 levels were not observed. Furthermore, findings were not adjusted for potential confounders other than baseline IL-6.</p><p>Our results are not consistent with a previous small study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] showing higher mental stress-induced IL-6 responses in men 30&#x000a0;min post-stress which was not sustained at 60&#x000a0;min. One explanation for this discordance is that the more robust inflammatory response and extended blood sampling implemented in our protocol made it possible to measure reliable sex effects. Of the several putative covariates examined in this study, time of testing, total household income, and, partially, baseline IL-6 levels were significant predictors in the multivariate model.</p><p>Few studies have been adequately powered to examine a wide range of factors that may theoretically be related to inflammatory reactivity. A previous study showed no associations between IL-6 level 45&#x000a0;min post-stress and grade of employment as an index of socioeconomic position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Likewise, we observed no associations between grade of employment and inflammatory responses. However, a significant association between total household income and IL-6 responses was observed here, so that compared to the highest income group, individuals in the lowest income category had higher reactivity scores. Given that socioeconomic inequalities in CVD tend to persist into older age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], greater pro-inflammatory responses to stress in lower SES individuals may be an important mechanism through which lower SES-related stress contributes to heightened risk of CVD.</p><p>We predicted that the effect size of the sex difference in pro-inflammatory responses might be of small magnitude. However, even after adjusting for several covariates including baseline IL-6, the effect we observed was of medium magnitude (<italic>f</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.15). Female participants produced nearly double the amount of pro-inflammatory IL-6 in response to acute stress compared to males (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This finding may therefore have important clinical implications. Several inflammatory-related conditions including rheumatoid arthritis and asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] are more prevalent in women, and stress has been identified as a trigger of symptom exacerbation. For example, emotional stress seems to exacerbate asthma symptoms through up-regulating HPA axis feedback loop leading to greater cytokine release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Pro-inflammatory cytokine release also plays a prominent role in negative mood symptoms and depressive disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and these conditions seem to be more common in post-menopausal women. Furthermore, prospective evidence demonstrates an association between IL-6 reactivity to stress and the development of subclinical hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Given that age-related hormonal changes predispose women to CVD risk, exaggerated inflammatory responses may be a mechanism underlying the association between sex and CVD risk.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The stress-induced pro-inflammatory IL-6 response in males and females. &#x02206;IL-6&#x02009;=&#x02009;mean difference in blood interleukin-6 between the 45&#x000a0;min post-stress and baseline samples, and between the 75&#x000a0;min post-stress and baseline samples.

Targeting stress-related responses through behavioral or pharmacological intervention aimed at reducing the magnitude of inflammatory reactivity might prove beneficial in vulnerable population such as post-menopausal women. However, it is important to note that several other factors other than inflammatory activity may contribute to the development of inflammatory-related conditions which were not addressed in this study. In addition, as noted in the &#x0201c;Introduction&#x0201d; section, there is a paucity of studies that have examined the link between inflammatory responses and disease risk prospectively. Therefore, some caution should also be used in interpreting the results showed herein given that, at present, the notion of up-regulated pro-inflammatory stress responses directly contributing to inflammatory-related disease development is not clearly supported by empirical evidence.</p><p>Several mechanisms may underlay the association between sex and inflammatory stress responses. Sex-dependent variations in estradiol hormonal levels between pre- and post-menopausal women, and men, may be responsible for the greater release of blood IL-6 in women observed in this study. Specifically, the sex effect observed might be driven by a specific inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression that is mediated through NF-kB binding of the hormone estradiol in post-menopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, other mechanisms may also be relevant. The adipose tissue is an important source of stress-induced IL-6 release. Therefore, sex differences in the sensitivity of adipose cells to sympathetic stimulation between the sexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] may account for the sex difference in IL-6 responses observed herein. Unfortunately, identifying the specific source of stress-induced IL-6 release would require the use of more invasive techniques that were not available in this study.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>Some limitations have to be highlighted. Several pro-inflammatory markers are activated by acute stress, but in this study the focus was on IL-6. It may be important to examine whether other stress-induced biomarkers also differ by sex or whether the sex effect is specific to IL-6. Our sample did not include pre-menopausal women, and it would have been informative to compare pre- and post-menopausal women, and men. To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, this is the first psychophysiologic stress study adequately powered to examine a wide range of sociodemographic, behavioral, and psychosocial factors that may confound the association of inflammatory responses with sex and to have an adequate blood sampling protocol that allowed examination of changes from baseline to up to 1&#x000a0;h and 15&#x000a0;min after stress.</p><p>We have demonstrated that female participants exhibit greater stress-induced IL-6 release, sustained to 75&#x000a0;min after stress exposure compared to males independent of a wide range of covariates. Sex-specific interventions to reduce the magnitude of inflammatory responses may prove beneficial in targeting stress-related symptom exacerbation in those conditions where inflammatory activity is prominent.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by the British Heart Foundation.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Slavich GM, Irwin MR.
