                <p>Mutations in the <italic>unc-23</italic> gene in the free-living nematode, <italic>Caenorhabditis
                    elegans
                </italic> result in detachment and dystrophy of the anterior body wall musculature and a bent-head
                    phenotype when grown on solid substrate. We have determined that the <italic>unc-23</italic> gene
                    product is the nematode ortholog of the human BAG-2 protein, a member of the Bcl-2 associated
                    athanogene (BAG) family of molecular chaperone regulators. We show that a functional GFP-tagged
                    UNC-23 protein is expressed throughout development in several tissues of the animal, including body
                    wall muscle and hypodermis, and associates with adhesion complexes and attachment structures within
                    these 2 tissues. In humans, the BAG protein family consists of 6 members that all contain a
                    conserved 45 amino acid BAG domain near their C-termini. These proteins bind to and modulate the
                    activity of the ATPase domain of the heat shock cognate protein 70, Hsc70. We have isolated missense
                    mutations in the ATPase domain of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> heat shock 70
                    protein, HSP-1 that suppress the phenotype exhibited by <italic>unc</italic>-<italic>
                        23</italic>(<italic>e25</italic>) mutant hermaphrodites and we show that UNC-23 and HSP-1
                    interact in a yeast-2-hybrid system. The interaction of UNC-23 with HSP-1 defines a role for HSP-1
                    function in the maintenance of muscle attachment during development.

            <p>Mechanical forces play a critical role in morphogenesis, tissue formation and the maintenance of cellular
                integrity throughout development. An excellent example of the requirement for mechanical force during
                morphogenesis is the development of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo, which involves the
                transformation of a round ball of cells into a long thin worm. This transformation entails large-scale
                cell shape changes, cell spreading and cell migrations, all of which require mechanical forces (for a
                review see ref.
                <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">
                    <sup>1</sup>
                </xref>
                ). The requirement for mechanical forces during embryogenesis is not limited to the <italic>C. elegans
                </italic> embryo. The process of gastrulation, which is common to multicellular embryos, requires
                mechanical forces that cause some cell layers to fold outwards while others bend and invaginate
                <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">
                    <sup>2</sup>
                </xref>
                (for a review see ref.
                <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">

                ).
            </p>
            <p>Tissue formation also involves mechanical forces. In order to bear different types of mechanical stresses
                such as tension, compression or shear, tissues produce highly specialized matrices such as skin, bone,
                and cartilage.

                Cells are able to control the deposition, composition and maintenance of molecules that make up their
                surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), based on the type and magnitude of the mechanical stresses that
                act on the tissue.
                <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">

                </xref>
                Cells under mechanical stress have also been shown to respond by changing the distribution of the
                structural components that associate with the cytoskeleton and anchoring junctions.
                <xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">

                </xref>
                The compositions of the biopolymers (i.e. microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments) that
                make up the cytoskeleton are tailored to accommodate the mechanical demand that is put on the cell.
                <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">
                    <sup>7</sup>
                </xref>
                The ability to rearrange the ECM and the cytoskeleton in the face of mechanical stresses is an essential
                response, one that allows the cell to maintain its shape and withstand forces that compromise cellular
                integrity. To keep their shape and maintain their integrity cells within a tissue must be capable of
                adaptive responses to various types of mechanical stresses.
            </p>
            <p>We are interested in elucidating some of the mechanisms and molecules involved in the maintenance of
                cell-ECM adhesion in tissues under physiological stress due to muscle attachment and movement. Movement
                in the free-living nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> involves transmission of the
                contractile force of the body wall muscle cells to the cuticle. This transmission is achieved via a
                continuous physical linkage between the body wall muscle and the cuticle through the basement membrane
                and hypodermis. Detailed anatomical studies on <italic>C. elegans</italic> have revealed 2 major
                extracellular matrices that are involved in motility: the basement membrane and the cuticle. The
                basement membrane is a specialized ECM that covers the pharynx, intestine, gonad, and body wall muscle
                cells, and is required for myofilament assembly in the body wall muscle.
                <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">

                </xref>
                The cuticle is required for embryonic morphogenesis, and provides the exoskeleton that covers the
                outside of the animal (for a review see ref. 10). In between the basement membrane and the cuticle is
                the hypodermis, which is the nematode's equivalent of skin. The hypodermis not only plays an important
                role in transmission of force from the muscle to the cuticle, it is also responsible for deposition of
                the cuticle and perhaps some basement membrane proteins.

                </xref>
                Hemidesmosomes, which are the cell-ECM anchoring junctions for the intermediate filaments, are located
                at both the basal and cuticular membranes of the hypodermis.
                <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">
                    <sup>8,11</sup>
                </xref>
                Hemidesmosomes provide the structural and physical linkage between the basement membrane and the cuticle
                and are therefore direct mediators of muscle to cuticle attachment. The association between the apical
                and basal hemidesmosomes is made by intermediate filaments, which not only connect the hemidesmosomes
                but also provide cellular integrity during force transmission .<sup>8</sup> Since the hypodermis is
                directly involved in the transfer of contractile force from muscle to cuticle, it affords a great
                opportunity to study the maintenance of cell-ECM attachment during muscle contraction.
            </p>
            <p>To better understand the mechanism involved in the maintenance of adhesion and cellular integrity during
                mechanical stress, several mutations that affect this pathway have been identified in <italic>C.

                These mutations have a very distinct phenotype, which manifests itself in early larval development and
                involves the progressive detachment of muscle cells from the underlying hypodermis. At least some of the
                genes defined by this class of mutation appear to be involved in cell-ECM adhesion including <italic>

                Among the original 619 mutants that were identified, only Unc-23 mutant animals exhibited a progressive
                dystrophy of the head musculature resulting in a bent-head phenotype. A detailed analysis of this unique
                phenotype revealed that mutations in the <italic>unc-23</italic> gene result in loss of hypodermal

                These observations suggest that the <italic>unc-23</italic> gene encodes a structural or a regulatory
                protein that is involved in the maintenance of muscle cell attachment to the hypodermis.
            </p>
            <p>In this paper we describe the identification and characterization of the <italic>unc-23</italic> gene
                product as the nematode ortholog of the human BAG-2 protein, a member of the Bcl-2 associated athanogene
                (BAG) family of molecular chaperone regulators. We also provide evidence that the UNC-23 protein
                interacts with the heat shock cognate protein 70, HSP-1 to maintain intracellular adhesion strength.

                <p>The <italic>unc</italic>-<italic>23</italic> gene potentially encodes 3 protein isoforms that differ
                    at their amino-termini. To ensure that the transgene we constructed for microinjection and
                    expression analysis could produce all 3 isoforms as GFP-tagged proteins, we amplified the
                    entire <italic>unc</italic>-<italic>23</italic> gene, including 2166&#x000a0;bp of promoter, from
                    genomic DNA and inserted the GFP encoding sequences at the 3' end of the gene upstream of the stop
                    codon. All UNC-23 protein isoforms made from this construct will have the GFP attached to their
                    C-terminal. Animals carrying the <italic>raEx20</italic> [<italic>unc-23</italic>::GFP; <italic>

                    at the 1.5-fold stage of embryogenesis in a few unidentified cells. Expression of the GFP-tagged
                    UNC-23 protein continues during embryogenesis and by the 3-fold stage, it has expanded to include
                    muscle, hypodermal and pharyngeal cells. In adult hermaphrodites GFP fluorescence is expressed in
                    the pharynx, body wall muscle cells, hypodermis, vulva, and H cells, as well as some unidentified
                    neurons and touch cells. In the hypodermis, UNC-23::GFP is distributed throughout the entire tissue
                    including some nuclei and nucleoli, and in addition, is localized in a pattern reminiscent of the
                    intermediate filaments

                    During embryonic development, muscle cells are capable of myofilament assembly, growth, contraction,
                    and attachment to the hypodermis in the absence of the <italic>unc-23</italic> gene product.
                    However, during mid-larval development body wall muscle cells in the head region of Unc-23 mutant
                    hermaphrodites begin to separate from the hypodermis, resulting in adults with heads that are
                    noticeably thinner than wild type animals. The resulting loss of control of the head causes a
                    bent-head phenotype when the animal tries to move forward. Detachment of the body wall musculature
                    from the hypodermis begins with the anterior-most cells and is usually confined to the head of the
                    animal (compare

                    blisters at the tip of the nose. The pharynx of Unc-23 mutant animals functions normally. The extent

                <p>Four of the 6 <italic>unc</italic>-<italic>23</italic> mutations that have been identified at the
                    sequence level are likely to affect all 3 predicted UNC-23 protein isoforms. The two nonsense
                    mutations should result in either the complete absence of any UNC-23 proteins, or perhaps, the
                    presence of truncated proteins that are missing all, or most of the BAG-2 homologous region of
                    UNC-23. Thus, the severe muscle detachment phenotype exhibited by animals homozygous for these
                    mutations most likely results from the complete absence of <italic>unc</italic>-<italic>23</italic> gene
                    function. Since hermaphrodites homozygous for the <italic>unc</italic>-<italic>23</italic>(<italic>
                        e25</italic>) missense mutation also exhibit a severe phenotype, this mutation is likely to
                    drastically reduce <italic>unc</italic>-<italic>23</italic> gene function as well. In these mutants,
                    muscle detachments extend just beyond the terminal bulb of the pharynx and involve both the dorsal
                    and ventral quadrants (shown in
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">

                    </xref>
                    ). The upper tissues completely collapse on top of the pharynx, resulting in complete loss of head
                    movement and a true bent-head phenotype. The GFP-tagged UNC-23 protein(s) produced by the <italic>
                        raEx20
                    </italic> transgenic array completely suppress this muscle detachment phenotype in <italic>
                        unc</italic>-<italic>23</italic>(<italic>e25</italic>) homozygous hermaphrodites (shown in
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">
                        <bold>Fig. 4C</bold>
                    </xref>
                    ).
                </p>
                <p>In mutants exhibiting a mild phenotype, the detachments do not extend past the anterior bulb of the
                    pharynx. Only the tip of the nose is affected and, for the most part, no head dragging is observed.
                    The sequence alterations responsible for the mild phenotype exhibited by strains carrying
                    either <italic>unc-23</italic>(<italic>ra801</italic>) or <italic>unc-23</italic>(<italic>
                        ra806</italic>) are known. Neither of these mutations is predicted to result in the complete
                    loss of <italic>unc</italic>-<italic>23</italic> gene function. The <italic>ra801</italic> mutation
                    is an in frame deletion that eliminates amino acid residues 17 to 55 of the longer protein isoforms,
                    but has no effect on the shortest UNC-23 protein. The <italic>ra806</italic> mutation is an out of
                    frame deletion near the 5' end of the <italic>unc</italic>-<italic>23</italic> gene that should
                    result in the complete absence of the longer UNC-23 proteins. However, the shortest UNC-23 protein
                    should still be present in animals homozygous for this mutation.

                    A.M.E. Bullerjahn and D. L. Riddle (pers. comm.) observed that <italic>unc-23(e25)</italic> mutant
                    animals grown in liquid culture fail to exhibit the bent-head phenotype. Suppression of the muscle
                    cell detachment phenotype lasts up to 48&#x000a0;hours after animals are placed on solid medium.
                    Here we have examined the effect of this temporary suppression of muscle detachment on the
                    arrangement of the myofilament lattice and on muscle cell positioning. In liquid grown adult worms,
                    anterior muscle cells are positioned correctly and the myofilaments appear normal when observed
                    under polarized light (shown in
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">

                    </xref>
                    ). However, these muscle cells are easily detached by mechanical stress. Application of external
                    force, such as putting worms under a coverslip and gently rolling them, can result in the detachment
                    of muscle quadrants from the underlying hypodermis. Subjecting wild-type animals to a similar
                    treatment does not result in any muscle cell detachment. In fact, wild type animals can withstand a
                    great deal more force than the <italic>unc-23(e25)</italic> mutant animals.

                    throughout the whole animal. It begins during larval development likely in response to mechanical
                    forces exerted while the animals are foraging for food. In Unc-23 mutant worms, muscle cells detach
                    whole from the underlying tissues. No detachment, fracturing, shearing, or separation of muscle
                    cells from each other is observed.

                    DNA sequences encoding the HSP-1 protein. The minimal region of the HSP-1 protein present in all of

                The protein structure of Hsc70 is conserved and can be divided into 3 functional segments, an N-terminal
                ATPase domain, a central substrate binding domain, and a C-terminal region that may act as a lid to the
                substrate-binding cleft (for a review see ref. 43). Substrate binding to Hsc70 is regulated by the
                binding, hydrolysis and exchange of ATP nucleotides.

                The ATP bound form of Hsc70 has a low overall affinity for its substrate while the ADP bound form of
                Hsc70 firmly binds to its substrate. The cycling of Hsc70 between these 2 different nucleotide states is
                regulated by several chaperone co-factors that bind Hsc70 and modulate its ATPase activity. BAG-1
                stimulates the release of ADP from the Hsc70 chaperone and, as a result, promotes the release of the
                bound substrate.

                In fact, restricted expression of UNC-23 to the muscle cells alone is not sufficient to rescue the
                bent-head phenotype of Unc-23 mutant animals (our unpublished results). Taken together these
                observations suggest that UNC-23 expression is required in the hypodermis to maintain the integrity of
                muscle cell attachments.

            <p>Based on the different phenotypes of <italic>unc</italic>-<italic>23</italic>(<italic>e25</italic>)
                homozygous animals grown in liquid or on plates, it is reasonable to predict that the interaction of
                UNC-23 with HSP-1 is required in biological pathways that respond to increasing contractile force by
                reinforcing the density and integrity of the hypodermal attachment structures. Muscle cells in liquid
                grown mutant hermaphrodites are capable of myofilament assembly, growth, contraction, and attachment.
                However, this attachment is not stable since applied external force or movement of worms on a solid
                substrate results in muscle detachment. Animals grown in liquid culture do not experience the shear
                force that plate-grown animals experience as they forage for food. Once animals are transferred to a
                solid substrate, they use their head muscles extensively to test the environment and forage for food.
                The use of the anterior muscle cells and the shear force exerted during movement initiates the muscle
                detachment and loss of hypodermal integrity in Unc-23 mutant hermaphrodites. This suggests that the
                integrity of the hypodermis is not challenged in liquid grown worms because there is less mechanical
                stress. The HSP-1 complex including UNC-23 and DNJ-13 must respond to cues involving mechanical stress.
                What those cues might be is currently unknown but may include RacGTPase, PAK-1, PIX-1 and GIT-1.

            <p>New proteins may be required in response to increasing contractile force to build up existing or newly
                formed attachment structures in the hypodermis. HSP-1 might be involved in folding, assembling, and
                chaperoning these newly made proteins to their locations. Likewise, in response to an increase in
                contractile force, certain proteins essential for the maintenance of cell-ECM attachments might be
                produced in larger amounts. Hsc70 chaperones have been shown to interact with several cytoskeletal

                Production of large amounts of intermediate filaments, for example, would be required at newly made
                hypodermal attachment sites and for the reinforcement of existing attachment structures to help maintain
                the integrity of the hypodermis. HSP-1 might bind the intermediate filaments to prevent their
                aggregation and chaperone them to their proper location. The chaperone functions of HSP-1 are not
                limited to interaction with intermediate filaments. Membrane bound receptors and structural proteins
                that make up the attachment structures and/or bind the intermediate filaments are other possible
                substrates for HSP-1. If UNC-23 functions as a negative regulator of HSP-1, in the same manner as BAG-2,
                then one might predict that the interaction of UNC-23 with HSP-1 is required for the release of the
                substrate from the binding cleft of HSP-1. In the absence of UNC-23, HSP-1 is unable to release its
                substrate in response to mechanical stresses experienced by the hypodermis. The sub-cellular
                localization of UNC-23 in the hypodermis is pertinent to this type of model, since its distribution is
                reminiscent of the distribution of the intermediate filaments within the hypodermis. The predicted role
                of UNC-23 as a regulator that promotes HSP-1 substrate release, agrees with the localization pattern
                observed in the hypodermis.
            </p>
            <p>It is important to note that the UNC-23/HSP-1 interaction is not necessary for the initial assembly and
                localization of attachment structures during embryogenesis, or for the maintenance of attachment
                structures within the body wall muscle cells. Given the number of biological pathways that HSP-1 is
                involved it is not surprising that loss of <italic>hsp-1</italic> gene function by RNA interference
                results in embryonic lethality.

                Mutations in the <italic>unc-23</italic> gene do not result in a similar phenotype; they only affect the
                hypodermal integrity and muscle cell attachment of the anterior body wall muscle cells. This suggests
                that the interaction of UNC-23 with HSP-1 provides specificity for HSP-1 function to the biological
                pathway(s) in the hypodermis that are involved in the maintenance of muscle attachment during
                development. UNC-23 as a chaperone regulator thus refines the amount of proteins deposited at adhesions

                    Briefly, colonies obtained on His<sup>-</sup> selection plates were transferred to adenine minus
                    (Ade<sup>-</sup>) plates to be re-screened for their positive interaction. The established colonies
                    on Ade<sup>-</sup> plates were transferred to a third selection plate containing 5-Fluoroorotic Acid
                    (FOA) to promote loss of the bait plasmid. The prey plasmid was recovered and re-transformed into
                    yDM#220 cells to confirm the initial positive interaction. DNA was isolated from the plasmids that
                    showed an interaction with yDM#220 and sequenced by the NAPS unit at the University of British
                    Columbia.
