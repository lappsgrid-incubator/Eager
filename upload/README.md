# Galaxy Upload Service

The Galaxy upload service waits for json (zip files) to arrive from the RabbitMQ server and unzips them into Galaxy's FTP directory.

Note that this service does not interact directly with Galaxy, it simply unzips files into Galaxy's FTP directory.

## Starting The Service

Since the upload service exposes management and metrix via JMX it must be started with the appropriate Java properties defined on the command line.  See the [start.sh](./start.sh) script for details.
